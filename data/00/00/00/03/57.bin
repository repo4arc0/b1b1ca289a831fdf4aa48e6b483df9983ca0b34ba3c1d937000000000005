00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,940

这并非战舰
This is not a warcraft.

43
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,570
我重复  这并非战舰
I repeat, this is not a warcraft.

44
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,130
听我说  你们应当开心
Hear me and rejoice.

45
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,550
你们有幸
You have had the privilege

46
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,970
被伟大泰坦所拯救
of being saved by the Great Titan.

47
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,650
你们或许觉得这是苦难
You may think this is suffering.

48
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,810
不是的
No.

49
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,980
这是拯救
It is salvation.

50
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,090
因为你们的牺牲
Universal scales tip toward balance

51
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,120
宇宙的天平又平衡了一些
because of your sacrifice.

52
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,660
笑笑吧
Smile.

53
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,580
即便是死了
For even in death,

54
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,210
你们也成为了灭霸的孩子
you have become Children of Thanos.

55
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,560
我懂得失败的感觉
I know what it's like to lose.

56
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,280
明明深切地知道你是对的
To feel so desperately that you're right...

57
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,610
却还是失败了
yet to fail, nonetheless.

58
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,460
是很可怕
It's frightening.

59
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,080
让人的腿发软
Turns the legs to jelly.

60
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,960
但我问你  这又何必
But I ask you, to what end?

61
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,680
害怕  逃避
Dread it, run from it...

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,680
命运总会到来
destiny arrives all the same.

63
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,850
现在  它来了
And now, it's here.

64
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,140
或者我该说
Or should I say...

65
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,190
我来了
I am.

66
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,150
你话太多了
You talk too much.

67
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,610
宇宙魔方
The Tesseract.

68
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,070
换你哥哥的脑袋
Or your brother's head.

69
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,870
你应该有所取舍吧
I assume you have a preference.

70
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,710
当然
Oh, I do.

71
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,380
杀了他吧
Kill away.

72
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,850
好吧  住手
All right, stop!

73
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,290
宇宙魔方不在我们这儿
We don't have the Tesseract.

74
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,280
它在阿斯加德上被毁了
It was destroyed on Asgard.

75
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,040
你真是最差劲的弟弟
You really are the worst brother.

76
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,210
我向你保证  哥哥
I assure you, brother...

77
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,880
我们还会时来运转的
the sun will shine on us again.

78
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,100
你的乐观用错了地方  阿斯加德人
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,020
首先  我不是阿斯加德人
Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

80
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,600
另外
And for another...

81
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,980
我们有绿巨人
we have a Hulk.

82
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,950
让他玩吧
Let him have his fun.

83
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,630
众神之父
Allfathers...

84
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,010
让黑暗魔法最后一次
let the dark magic flow through me one last...

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,510
流过我
time.

86
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,360
那是个错误
That was a mistake.

87
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,750
不
No!

88
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,590
我会要你偿命的
You're going to die for that.

89
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,730
卑微的我
My humble personage...

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,530
向您的伟大臣服
bows before your grandeur.

91
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,780
从没有过什么人  如此强大
No other being has ever had the might...

92
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,780
如此崇高
nay, the nobility...

93
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,960
能够操控不仅一枚  而是两枚无限宝石的力量
to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

94
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,710
宇宙已经唾手可得
The universe lies within your grasp.

95
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,630
地球上还有两颗
There are two more stones on Earth.

96
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,720
找到它们  我的孩子  带去泰坦星上给我
Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

97
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,740
父亲  我们不会辜负你的
Father, we will not fail you.

98
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,890
容我插嘴
If I might interject.

99
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,680
如果你们要去地球  你们或许需要向导
If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide.

100
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,020
我在这方面还有点经验
I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

101
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,750
如果你认为失败也算经验的话
If you consider failure experience.

102
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,570
我认为经验就是经验
I consider experience experience.

103
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,200
全能的灭霸
Almighty Thanos...

104
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,150
我  洛基  阿斯加德王子
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

105
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,910
奥丁森
Odinson...

106
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,050
约顿海姆的合法国王
the rightful king of Jotunheim...

107
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,760
恶作剧之神
god of mischief...

108
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,550
在此向你宣誓
do hereby pledge to you...

109
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,140
不死的忠诚
my undying fidelity.

110
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,440
不死
Undying?

111
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,740
你措辞该更小心点的
You should choose your words more carefully.

112
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,890
你
You...

113
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,810
永远不会成为
will never be...

114
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,640
神
a god.

115
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,030
不
No!

116
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,300
这次别想复活了
No resurrections this time.

117
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,200
不  洛基
No. Loki.

118
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,950
你真的一点钱都没有吗
Seriously, you don't have any money?

119
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,340
对物质的依恋  就是与精神的断层
Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

120
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,720
我会把这话告诉熟食店的人的
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

121
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,810
或许他们能给你做个形而上的黑面包火腿三明治
Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

122
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,770
等等  我好像有两百
Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

123
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,630
美元吗
Dollars?

124
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,250
-卢比  -那是多少
- Rupees. - Which is?

125
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,170
1.5美元
Buck and a half.

126
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,340
你想要什么
What do you want?

127
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,760
金枪鱼三明治倒是不错
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

128
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,400
灭霸要来了
Thanos is coming.

129
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,400
他要来了
He's coming.

130
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,570
谁
Who?

131
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,010
慢点  慢点
Slow down, slow down.

132
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,270
-我解释给你听  -你在说胡话呢
- I'll spell it out for you. - You're totally rambling.

133
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,230
-没有啦  -我没听懂
- No, I'm not. - You lost me.

134
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,890
你知道那种  做梦的时候
Look, you know how you're having a dream,

135
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,020
觉得要上厕所的感觉吧
and in the dream you gotta pee.

136
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,190
-嗯  -好
- Yeah. - Okay.

137
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,270
然后你会发现  "天呐
And then you're like, "Oh, my God.

138
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,020
怎么到处都没厕所  怎么办啊
"There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?

139
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,870
-有人在看啊"  -是啊
- "Oh, someone's watching." - Right.

140
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,190
-"我要尿裤子了"  -然后你醒过来
- "Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants." - And then you wake up

141
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,940
发现你其实是真想尿尿
and in real life you actually have to pee.

142
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,200
-没错  -嗯
- Yes. - Yeah.

143
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,450
-好  -每个人都做这种梦
- Okay. - Everybody has that.

144
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,270
是啊  这就是我想说的
Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

145
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,560
关于这一点  昨晚  我梦到我们生了个孩子
Apropos of that, last night I dreamt we had a kid.

146
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,190
感觉可真了
It was so real.

147
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,460
我们还以一个奇怪的叔叔给他起了名
We named him after your eccentric uncle.

148
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,330
他叫什么来着
Uh, what was his name?

149
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,360
-哦  -摩根  摩根
- Right. - Morgan! Morgan.

150
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,710
-于是你醒来  -当然了
- So you woke up... - Naturally.

151
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,990
觉得我们...
...and thought that we were...

152
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,550
-要有了  -嗯
- Expecting. - Yeah.

153
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,510
-有吗  -没有
- Yes? - No.

154
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,090
我梦到了  可真了
I had a dream about it. It was so real.

155
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,450
如果你想要孩子
If you wanted to have a kid...

156
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,370
你就不会这么做了
you wouldn't have done that.

157
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,140
我很高兴你提到了这个  因为这没什么
I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing.

158
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,850
就是纳米粒子的储存器
It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

159
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,180
这话是帮倒忙
You're not helping your case, okay?

160
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,640
不  这是能拆掉的
No, this is detachable. It's not a...

161
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,050
你不需要它
You don't need that.

162
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,360
我知道  我做了手术
I know, I had the surgery.

163
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,840
我就是想保护我们
I'm just trying to protect us...

164
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,610
还有未来更多的我们什么的
and future usses and that's it.

165
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,490
以防衣橱里藏了怪物
Just in case there's a monster in the closet.

166
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,260
-而不是  -衬衫
- Instead of, you know... - Shirts.

167
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,990
你好了解我
You know me so well.

168
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,810
-天呐  -你还能接我的话
- God. - You finish all my sentences.

169
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,900
你的衣橱里该放衬衣
You should have shirts in your closet.

170
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,690
是啊
Yeah.

171
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,670
知道该有什么吗  再不制造意外了
You know what there should be? No more surprises.

172
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,040
我们今晚好好吃顿晚饭
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

173
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,860
炫耀下这枚海瑞温斯顿的钻戒
Show off this Harry Winston.

174
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,760
是吧  今后再不制造什么意外了
Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

175
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,970
我要向你保证
I should promise you.

176
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,240
-好  -真的
- Yes. - I will.

177
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,660
谢谢
Thank you.

178
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,620
托尼·斯塔克
Tony Stark.

179
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,420
我是斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇博士  我需要你跟我来
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.

180
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,630
恭喜你们要结婚了
Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

181
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,880
抱歉  你是卖票的吗
I'm sorry, you giving out tickets to something?

182
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,010
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

183
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,400
可以不夸张地说
It's not overselling it to say that

184
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
这事关全宇宙的命运
the fate of the universe is at stake.

185
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,600
"我们"是谁
And who's "we"?

186
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,600
托尼
Hey, Tony.

187
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,640
布鲁斯
Bruce.

188
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,850
派珀
Pepper.

189
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,730
你没事吧
You okay?

190
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,070
宇宙之初
At the dawn of the universe,

191
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,530
是一片虚无  然后...
there was nothing. Then...

192
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,040
大爆炸把六颗元素水晶
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

193
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,540
抛到了新宇宙的深处
hurtling across the virgin universe.

194
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,310
这些无限宝石
These Infinity Stones

195
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,380
每一颗都控制一种存在的基本方面
each control an essential aspect of existence.

196
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,500
空间
Space.

197
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,800
现实
Reality.

198
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,300
力量
Power.

199
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,970
灵魂
Soul.

200
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,140
心灵
Mind.

201
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,430
还有时间
And Time.

202
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,320
再跟我说一遍他的名字
Tell me his name again.

203
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,450
灭霸
Thanos.

204
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,920
他就像瘟疫  托尼
He's a plague, Tony.

205
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,090
他入侵星球  肆意夺取
He invades planets. He takes what he wants.

206
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,430
抹去半数人口
He wipes out half the population.

207
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,870
当初是他派洛基来的
He sent Loki.

208
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,500
纽约的袭击  是他搞的鬼
The attack on New York, that's him.

209
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,380
决战来了
This is it.

210
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,640
我们还有多少时间
What's our timeline?

211
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,110
不知道  他拿到了力量和空间宝石
No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones.

212
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,900
这已经使他成为全宇宙最有威力的人了
That already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe.

213
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,030
如果他拿到全部六颗宝石  托尼
If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...

214
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,740
他能以此前无法想象的方式毁灭生命
He could destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

215
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,700
你刚刚真的说了"此前无法想象"吗
Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

216
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,990
你真的要倚在宇宙大锅上吗
Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

217
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,020
是叫这个吗
Is that what it is?

218
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,980
我就不跟你计较了
I'm going to allow that.

219
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,250
如果灭霸需要全部六颗
If Thanos needs all six,

220
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,210
那我们何不毁了这颗
why don't we just stick this one down a garbage disposal?

221
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,260
不行
No can do.

222
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,470
我们曾起誓要以性命维护时间宝石
We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives.

223
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,740
我还曾起誓要戒掉乳制品
And I swore off dairy...

224
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,100
但班杰瑞以我命名了一种冰淇淋口味
but then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

225
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,890
-斯塔克狂热榛仁  -不赖啊
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts. - Not bad.

226
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,100
有点牙碜
A bit chalky.

227
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,180
我最喜欢大块绿巨人热巧克力
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge is our favorite.

228
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,100
-有这玩意吗  -不重要
- That's a thing? - Whatever.

229
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,690
重点是  情况会变
Point is, things change.

230
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,520
我们保护时间宝石的誓言不能改变
Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change.

231
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,480
这颗宝石可能是我们对抗灭霸的最佳机会了
And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

232
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,400
那么反过来
Yeah, so conversely,

233
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,780
也可能是他对付我们的最佳机会
it may also be his best chance against us.

234
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,360
如果我们不能尽职的话
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

235
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,240
你的职责究竟是什么
What is your job exactly?

236
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,140
除了捏气球动物
Besides making balloon animals.

237
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,790
保护你的现实  混球
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

238
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,580
好了  各位  我们能先别吵吗
Okay, guys. Could we table this discussion right now?

239
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,540
事实就是  我们有这颗宝石
The fact is we have this stone.

240
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,280
我们知道它在哪
We know where it is.

241
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,710
幻视还带着心灵宝石不知道人在何处呢
Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone...

242
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,950
我们得马上找到他
and we have to find him now.

243
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,970
问题就在这里
Yeah, that's the thing.

244
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,880
什么意思
What do you mean?

245
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,500
两周前  幻视关闭了他的应答机
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder.

246
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,430
他下线了
He's offline.

247
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,500
-什么  -嗯
- What? - Yeah.

248
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,850
托尼  你又弄丢一个超级机器人
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

249
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,350
我没弄丢他  他没那么简单了  他在进化
I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

250
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,840
那谁能找到幻视
Who could find Vision then?

251
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,880
该死
Shit.

252
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,570
史蒂夫·罗杰斯或许能
Probably Steve Rogers.

253
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,760
太好了
Oh, great.

254
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,970
或许吧
Maybe.

255
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:55,760
但是
But...

256
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,390
打给他
Call him.

257
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,350
没那么简单
It's not that easy.

258
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,790
天呐  我们真是好久没联络了  是吧
God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

259
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,570
是啊
No.

260
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,690
复仇者联盟解散了  我们完了
The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

261
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,240
解散了
Broke up?

262
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,260
像乐队那样吗  像披头士那样吗
Like a band? Like... Like the Beatles?

263
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,990
队长和我闹得很僵
Cap and I fell out hard.

264
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,790
我们现在不说话了
We're not on speaking terms.

265
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,040
托尼  听我说
Tony, listen to me.

266
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,540
托尔死了
Thor's gone.

267
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,350
灭霸要来了
Thanos is coming.

268
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,670
你跟不跟谁说话都无所谓了
It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

269
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,770
翻盖手机
Flip phone.

270
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,010
博士  你是在自己动头发吗
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would ya?

271
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,340
现在没有
Not at the moment, no.

272
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,000
你没事吧
You okay?

273
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,750
-帮帮他  -班纳
- Help him! - Banner!

274
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,510
-王  精神点  -去吧  我们能行
- Wong! Look alive! - Go, go! We got it!

275
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,730
星期五  什么情况
Friday, what am I looking at?

276
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,510
不确定  我还在查看
Not sure. I'm working on it.

277
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,320
你最好把时间宝石
You might wanna put that Time Stone

278
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,850
塞后兜里  博士
in your back pocket, Doc!

279
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,260
还是用它更好
Might wanna use it.

280
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,230
内德  我需要你分散大家的注意
Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

281
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,590
我去
Holy shit.

282
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,250
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die!

283
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,730
那里有架飞船
There's a spaceship!

284
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,420
-怎么回事啊  -天呐
- What's going on? - Oh, my God!

285
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,910
你们这些孩子怎么回事
What's the matter with you kids?

286
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,190
没见过宇宙飞船啊
You never seen a spaceship before?

287
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,800
星期五  疏散43街以南的群众
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street.

288
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,880
通知应急人员

289
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:04,740

You are about to die

292
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,740
灭霸的孩子手下
at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

293
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,530
心怀感激吧
Be thankful...

294
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,050
你们毫无意义的人生将贡献...
that your meaningless lives are now contributing...

295
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,830
抱歉  地球今天歇业
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

296
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,770
你们最好收拾东西滚蛋
You better pack it up and get outta here.

297
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,960
宝石守护者
Stonekeeper.

298
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,190
这喋喋不休的动物能替你说话吗
Does this chattering animal speak for you?

299
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,010
当然不  我想说什么自己说
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

300
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,140
你们在这座城市和这颗星球都不受欢迎
You're trespassing in this city and on this planet.

301
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,570
就是滚蛋的意思  章鱼哥
He means get lost, Squidward.

302
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,890
他让我厌烦
He exhausts me.

303
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,810
把宝石拿来给我
Bring me the stone.

304
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,600
班纳  你想出手吗
Banner, you want a piece?

305
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,160
并不想
No, not really.

306
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,790
但我什么时候如愿过了
But when do I ever get what I want?

307
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,610
这就对了
That's right.

308
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,960
好  加把劲
Okay. Push!

309
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,820
好久没见了
It's been a while.

310
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,030
能再见到你会很高兴的  哥们
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

311
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:21,860
好吧
Okay.

312
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,160
容我...我得集中精神
Let me just... I need to concentrate here for a second.

313
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,780
来啊  拜托
Come on, come on, man.

314
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,330
天呐
God!

315
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,790
那家伙呢
Where's your guy?

316
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,220
我不知道  我们最近有点问题
I don't know. We've sorta been having a thing.

317
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,350
-现在不是有问题的时候  -我知道
- It's no time for a thing. - I know.

318
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,710
那才是问题  来吧
That's the thing right there. Let's go.

319
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
哥们  你让我在巫师面前下不来台了
Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

320
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,610
托尼  抱歉  不是我不能  就是他不想
Tony, I'm sorry. Either I can't or he won't.

321
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,350
没事的
It's okay.

322
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,030
退后吧  替我看着点他  谢谢
Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

323
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,690
-交给我吧  -该死
- I have him. - Damn it.

324
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,550
那是哪来的
Where'd that come from?

325
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,400
是纳米科技
It's nanotech.

326
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,340
喜欢吗  是我...
You like it? A little something I...

327
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,770
班纳博士  如果你的绿朋友不打算来了
Doctor Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...

328
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,960
快把宝石送走
Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

329
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,340
我人在宝石在
It stays with me.

330
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,570
没错  再见
Exactly. Bye.

331
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,330
托尼  你没事吧
Tony, you okay?

332
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,560
-情况怎么样  是好是坏  -可好了
- How we doing? Good? Bad? - Really, really good.

333
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,980
可好了  你想不想帮忙啊
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

334
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,290
我也想  他不肯出来
I'm trying. He won't come out.

335
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,590
锤子
Hammer.

336
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,870
拜托  绿巨人  你这是干什么啊
Come on, Hulk! What are you doing to me?

337
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,370
出来啊  出来啊
Come out! Come out! Come out!

338
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,270
不要
No!

339
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,070
什么叫"不要"
What do you mean, "No"?

340
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,720
好啊  斯塔克先生  你好吗
Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

341
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,840
孩子  你哪冒出来的
Kid, where'd you come from?

342
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,580
学校组织去现代艺术博物馆
A field trip to MoMA.

343
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,680
这家伙什么毛病  斯塔克先生
What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

344
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,890
他是外太空来的
Uh, he's from space.

345
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,250
他是来偷一个巫师的项链的
He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

346
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,670
你的能力很有意思
Your powers are quaint.

347
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,700
你一定很受孩子的喜欢吧
You must be popular with children.

348
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,300
虽然是简单的咒语  但不可攻破
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

349
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,580
那我就先杀了你再拿
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

350
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,380
你会发现
You'll find

351
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,330
想解除
removing

352
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,160
一个死人的咒语
a dead man's spell

353
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,870
会很困难
troublesome.

354
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,850
你会生不如死
You'll only wish you were dead.

355
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,030
不
No!

356
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,130
孩子  就是那个巫师  快去
Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

357
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,830
去了
On it!

358
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,420
好过分
Not cool.

359
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,130
抓到你了
Gotcha!

360
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,260
等等
Wait!

361
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,810
斯塔克先生  我被光吸上去了
Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

362
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,110
撑着  孩子
Hang on, kid.

363
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,750
王  我婚礼你一定要来
Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

364
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,050
给我点动力  星期五
Give me a little juice, Friday.

365
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,440
启动17A
Unlock 17:A.

366
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,760
彼得  放手吧  我来接住你
Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

367
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,460
但你叫我救巫师的
But you said save the wizard!

368
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,670
我不能呼吸了
I can't breathe.

369
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,420
我们太高了  你要没空气了
We're too high up. You're running out of air.

370
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,550
是啊  这讲得通
Yeah. That makes sense.

371
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,770
斯塔克先生  这里面闻起来像新车
Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

372
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
一路顺风  孩子
Happy trails, kid.

373
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,530
-星期五  送他回家  -好
- Friday, send him home. - Yep.

374
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,450
拜托
Oh, come on!

375
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,970
老板  波茨小姐来电
Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

376
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,180
托尼  天呐
Tony? Oh, my God.

377
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,600
你没事吧  怎么回事啊
Are you all right? What's going on?

378
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,180
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

379
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,650
但我们8:30的预约可能得延期了
I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.

380
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,380
为什么
Why?

381
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,720
就是我可能一时半会儿回不去
Just 'cause I'll probably not make it back for a while.

382
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,050
告诉我你没在那艘飞船上
Tell me you're not on that ship.

383
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:18,900
嗯
Yeah.

384
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,390
天呐  不  告诉我你没在那艘飞船上
God, no, please tell me you're not on the ship.

385
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,930
亲爱的  对不起
Honey, I'm sorry.

386
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,030
对不起  我不知道该怎么说
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

387
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,870
给我回来  托尼  我发誓
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God.

388
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,890
-派珀  -赶紧给我回来
- Pep. - Come back here right now.

389
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,410
回来
Come back.

390
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,020
老板  信号要断了
Boss, we're losing her.

391
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,190
我也去
I'm going too.

392
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,490
天呐
Oh, my God!

393
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,040
我就该待在校车上
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

394
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,390
你去哪
Where you going?

395
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
时间宝石被夺走了
The Time Stone's been taken.

396
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,600
圣殿无人守护
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

397
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,270
你要怎么办
What will you do?

398
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,980
我要打个电话
I'm gonna make a call.

399
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,500
{\an9}BGM: Rubberband Man  By  The Spinners

400
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,520
唱吧  德拉克斯
Sing it, Drax!

401
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,800
我们为什么要这么做来着
Why are we doing this again?

402
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,510
有人发了求救信号  火箭
It's a distress signal, Rocket.

403
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,600
可能有人有危险
Someone could be dying.

404
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,100
这我懂  但我们为什么要来
I get that, but why are we doing it?

405
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,170
因为我们是好人
'Cause we're nice.

406
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,900
或许求救的人
And maybe whoever it is

407
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,690
会给我们点切达奶酪作为感谢
will give us a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

408
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,180
-这不是重点  -这不是重点
- Which isn't the point. - Which isn't the point.

409
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,400
如果他不给谢礼
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

410
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,320
我们就夺他的船
We take his ship.

411
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,450
-没错  -正确
- Exactly! - Bingo!

412
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,310
好嘞
All right!

413
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,940
我们要到了
We are arriving.

414
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,200
好了  护卫队
All right, Guardians,

415
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,870
别忘了  情况可能很危险
don't forget this might be dangerous...

416
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,020
大家都凶起来
so let's put on our mean faces.

417
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,840
格鲁特  马上把那玩意放起来
Groot, put that thing away, now.

418
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,030
别让我再说你
I don't wanna tell you again.

419
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,200
格鲁特
Groot.

420
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,870
我是格鲁特
I am Groot!

421
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,040
怎么说话呢
Language!

422
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,930
你胆子不小  小子
You got some acorns on you, kid.

423
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,430
自从你开始分泌树液
Ever since you got a little sap,

424
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,170
你就变成了个小混蛋
you're a total d-hole.

425
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,920
再这么下去  我就把那玩意给砸了
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces.

426
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,140
发生了什么
What happened?

427
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,600
天呐
Oh, my God.

428
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,440
看来我们别想拿钱了
Looks like we're not getting paid.

429
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,380
开雨刷  开雨刷
Wipers! Wipers!

430
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,160
把它弄掉
Get it off.

431
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,790
这哥们怎么会还活着
How the hell is this dude still alive?

432
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,790
他不是个"哥们"
He is not a dude.

433
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,460
你是个哥们
You're a dude.

434
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,710
这  是个男人
This... This is a man.

435
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,430
一个帅气的肌肉男
A handsome, muscular man.

436
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,230
我也挺肌肉的
I'm muscular.

437
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,490
你骗谁呢  奎尔
But who are you kidding, Quill?

438
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,280
你再吃一个三明治就是一身肥膘了
You're one sandwich away from fat.

439
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,110
得了吧
Yeah, right.

440
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,950
没错  奎尔  你是胖了点
It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.

441
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,680
什么
What?

442
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,520
卡魔拉  你也觉得我...
Gamora, do you think I'm...

443
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,650
他很焦虑  愤怒
He is anxious, angry.

444
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,200
他失去了很多  非常愧疚
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

445
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,740
简直就像一个海盗跟一个天使生了个孩子
It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

446
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,720
这对我真是一记警钟啊  好吧
This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

447
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,560
我去买个博飞健身器  认真减肥
I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.

448
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,850
再去弄个哑铃
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

449
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,310
你知道哑铃是不能吃的吧
You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

450
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,730
他的肌肉就像是柯塔蒂金属纤维做的
It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.

451
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,710
别给他的肌肉按摩了
Stop massaging his muscles.

452
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,340
弄醒他
Wake him up.

453
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,220
醒来
Wake.

454
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,700
你们是谁
Who the hell are you guys?

455
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,330
自从我认识灭霸  他就只有一个目标
The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

456
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,220
让宇宙获得平衡
To bring balance to the universe

457
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,330
方法是抹去一半生命
by wiping out half of all life.

458
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,550
他以前会一个个星球地杀人
He used to kill people planet by planet,

459
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,510
一次次地进行屠杀
massacre by massacre.

460
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,760
包括我的星球
Including my own.

461
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,730
如果他拿到全部六颗无限宝石
If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

462
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,390
那他打一个响指就能实现愿望
he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

463
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,260
你似乎对灭霸很了解
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

464
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,890
卡魔拉是灭霸的女儿
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

465
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,980
你父亲杀了我弟弟
Your father killed my brother.

466
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,030
天呐
Oh, boy.

467
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,250
严格讲是继父
Stepfather, technically.

468
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,950
她跟你一样恨他
And she hates him as much as you do.

469
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,160
家家有本难念的经
Families can be tough.

470
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,800
我父亲死前
Before my father died,

471
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,930
才跟我说我还有个异母姐姐
he told me that I had a half-sister...

472
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,500
被他囚禁在了地狱
that he imprisoned in Hel.

473
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,390
然后她回了家  捅瞎了我的眼睛
And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.

474
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,940
于是我不得不杀了她
So I had to kill her.

475
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,670
人生啊  是吧
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

476
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,630
兜兜转转
Goes round and round and...

477
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,110
我能理解你的痛苦
I feel your pain.

478
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,740
我也能理解你的痛苦
I feel your pain as well, because...

479
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,700
虽然这不是比赛
I mean, it's not a competition,

480
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,410
但我也吃过不少苦
but I've been through a lot.

481
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,070
我爸杀了我妈
My father killed my mother.

482
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,980
然后我不得不杀了我爸
And then I had to kill my father.

483
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,230
那可痛苦了
That was hard.

484
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,690
可能比杀姐姐还痛苦
Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

485
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,630
而且我还两眼完好无损地回来了
Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...

486
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,530
我需要一把锤子  不是勺子
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

487
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,820
这玩意怎么开  有什么...
How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...

488
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,540
四位密码  是生日吗
A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

489
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,580
-你干什么呢  -开走你们的飞行舱
- What are you doing? - Taking your pod.

490
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,290
你别想
No, you're not.

491
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,010
你今天别想开走我们的飞行舱  先生
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

492
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,340
奎尔  你是在故意把嗓音压低吗
Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

493
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,350
-没有  -就有
- No. - You are.

494
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,620
你在模仿那个男神  好奇怪
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

495
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,640
我没有
No, I'm not.

496
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,690
-他又来了  -我的嗓音就是这样
- He just did it again! - This is my voice.

497
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,360
你在嘲笑我吗
Are you mocking me?

498
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,410
-你在嘲笑我吗  -别闹了  你又那样了
- Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.

499
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,590
他想模仿我
He's trying to copy me.

500
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,430
你给我停下
I need you to stop doing that.

501
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,090
-够了  -他先开始的
- Enough! - He's doing it first.

502
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,760
我们得阻止灭霸
We need to stop Thanos.

503
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,390
所以  我们得查明
Which means we need to find out

504
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,310
他接下来要去哪
where he's going next.

505
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,290
虚无知地[不去哪]
Knowhere.

506
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,640
他肯定会去什么地方的
He must be going somewhere.

507
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,420
不对  虚无知地吗
No, no. Knowhere?

508
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,050
那是个地方  我们去过  烂爆了
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

509
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,970
-抱歉  那是我们的食物  -现在不是了
- Excuse me, that's our food. - Not anymore.

510
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,600
托尔  他为什么要去虚无知地
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

511
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,110
因为多年来
Because for years...

512
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,450
现实宝石一直安全地放在那里
the Reality Stone's been safely stored there

513
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,030
在一个叫收藏者的人手上
with a man called the Collector.

514
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,040
如果是在收藏者手上  那就不安全了
If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe.

515
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,580
只有白痴才会把宝石交给那人
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

516
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,160
-或是天才  -你怎么知道
- Or a genius. - How do you know...

517
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,360
他不会去找其他的宝石
he's not going for one of the other stones?

518
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,860
一共有六颗宝石
There are six stones out there.

519
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,880
灭霸已经拿到了力量宝石
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

520
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,450
那是他上周摧毁山达尔星时偷走的
because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.

521
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,620
他从我这儿偷走了空间宝石
He stole the Space Stone from me...

522
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,540
还摧毁了我的飞船  杀了我一半人民
when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.

523
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,720
时间和心灵宝石在地球上很安全
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

524
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
在复仇者联盟手里
They're with the Avengers.

525
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,100
-复仇者联盟  -地球最强大的英雄
- The Avengers? - Earth's mightiest heroes.

526
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,190
就像凯文·贝肯吗
Like Kevin Bacon?

527
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,600
或许有他吧  我不知道
He may be on the team. I don't know.

528
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,980
我挺久没回去了
I haven't been there in a while.

529
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,440
至于灵魂宝石  根本没人见过
As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that.

530
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,890
都没人知道它在哪
No one even knows where it is.

531
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,820
因此灭霸得不到它
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

532
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,530
因此他会去虚无知地
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

533
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,850
好拿到现实宝石
Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

534
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,980
不客气
You're welcome.

535
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,700
那我们得马上去虚无知地
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

536
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,860
不  我们得去尼德威阿尔
Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

537
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,790
-那个词是编出来的  -所有词都是编出来的
- That's a made-up word. - All words are made up.

538
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,900
尼德威阿尔是真的  你认真的吗
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

539
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,300
那地方是个传奇
That place is a legend.

540
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,450
他们能造出最强大  最可怕的武器
They make the most powerful, horrific weapons

541
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,260
来折腾整个宇宙
to ever torment the universe.

542
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,550
我可是非常愿意去的
I would very much like to go there, please.

543
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,510
这只兔子说的对
The rabbit is correct

544
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,220
它显然是你们当中最聪明的
and clearly the smartest among you.

545
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,130
-兔子  -只有矮人伊特里能造出我需要的武器
- Rabbit?  - Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

546
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,060
你就是船长吧  先生
I assume you're the captain, sir.

547
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,140
有眼光
You're very perceptive.

548
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,480
你看起来像个高贵的领袖
You seem like a noble leader.

549
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,230
你愿意跟我一起去尼德威阿尔吗
Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

550
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,230
让我问下船长  等一下  我就是船长
Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!

551
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,890
-好  我加入  -太棒了
- Yeah. I'll go. - Wonderful!

552
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,740
不过  我才是船长
Except for that I'm the captain.

553
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,280
安静
Quiet.

554
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,160
-那是我的背包  -坐下吧你
- That's my backpack. - Go sit down.

555
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,950
这是我的飞船
Look, this is my ship.

556
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,310
我才不会去什么...
And I'm not goin' to...

557
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,040
等一下  那是什么样的武器
Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?

558
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,730
能杀灭霸的那种
The Thanos-killing kind.

559
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,790
你不觉得我们每个人都应该弄把那样的武器吗
Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

560
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,960
不  你们没有驾驭它们的力量
No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.

561
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,920
你们的身体会碎裂
Your bodies would crumble

562
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,590
思维会崩溃  甚至疯掉
as your minds collapsed into madness.

563
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,340
我现在更想要了  会不会很奇怪
Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

564
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,420
没错  是有一点
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

565
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,010
如果我们不去虚无知地
If we don't go to Knowhere

566
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,890
而灭霸又得到一颗宝石
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

567
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,430
他就会强大得不可阻挡了
he'll be too powerful to stop.

568
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,100
-他已经不可阻挡了  -我有办法了
- He already is. - I got it figured out.

569
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,640
我们有两艘船
We got two ships

570
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,600
和一群各种各样的白痴
and a large assortment of morons.

571
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,230
我和格鲁特跟这位海盗天使走
So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.

572
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,860
白痴们去虚无知地
And the morons will go to Knowhere

573
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,720
试图阻止灭霸
to try to stop Thanos.

574
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,990
-好吗  好  -很好
- Cool? Cool. - So cool.

575
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,930
就说一句
For the record...

576
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,110
我知道你跟他走
I know that you're going with him

577
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,570
是因为灭霸不在那里
because it's where Thanos isn't.

578
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,990
你真的不应该
You know, you really shouldn't

579
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,770
这样跟你的船长讲话  奎尔
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

580
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,650
走了  格鲁特
Come on, Groot.

581
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,730
把游戏放下  你的脑子会烂掉的
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

582
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,200
再会了  祝你们好运  白痴们
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

583
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,410
再见
Bye.

584
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,470
小幻
Vis?

585
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,680
又是宝石
Is it the stone again?

586
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,890
它好像在跟我说话
It's as if it's speaking to me.

587
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,640
它说什么
What does it say?

588
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,770
我...不知道  但它说了些什么
I don't... I don't know, but something.

589
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,200
告诉我你感觉到了什么
Tell me what you feel.

590
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,380
我只感觉到了你
I just feel you.

591
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,030
10点有一班去格拉斯哥的列车
So there's a 10:00 A.M. to Glasgow...

592
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,240
这样你回去之前  我们还能一起多待会儿
which would give us more time together before you went back.

593
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,640
如果我错过那班车呢
What if I miss that train?

594
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,070
11点还有一班
There's an 11:00.

595
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,060
如果我错过所有车次呢
What if I missed all the trains?

596
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,830
这次我不回去了怎么样
What if this time I didn't go back?

597
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,250
但你向斯塔克承诺过
But you gave Stark your word.

598
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,670
我更想向你许下承诺
I'd rather give it to you.

599
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,750
也有人在等我回去
Well, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.

600
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,210
我们都做过承诺
We both made promises.

601
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,280
但没对彼此承诺过
Not to each other.

602
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,530
旺达
Wanda.

603
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,880
两年了  我们偷来了这些相处的时光
For two years, we've stolen these moments...

604
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,450
想看看我们是不是合得来
trying to see if this could work and...

605
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,000
我不知道
I don't know.

606
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,640
我只想说说自己的看法
You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

607
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,980
我觉得...
I think...

608
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,060
-我们合得来  -是啊
- It works. - It works.

609
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,960
是啊
It works.

610
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,760
留下来
Stay.

611
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,220
留下陪我
Stay with me.

612
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,270
或者算了  如果我出格了
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

613
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,280
他们是什么
What are they?

614
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,150
正是宝石警告我的东西
What the stone was warning me about.

615
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,210
我得走了
I have to go.

616
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,830
不  幻视
No, Vision.

617
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,540
幻视  如果那是真的
Vision, if that's true,

618
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,590
那也许回去不是最好的选择
then maybe going isn't the best idea.

619
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,420
旺达  我...
Wanda, I...

620
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,880
幻视
Vision!

621
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,670
那刀刃  让我无法变相
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

622
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,000
-那可能吗  -不该这样的
- Is that even possible? - It isn't supposed to be.

623
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,210
我的系统正在崩溃
My systems are failing.

624
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,220
我开始觉得我们不该下床了
I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.

625
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,930
小幻
Vis!

626
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,190
放弃宝石  她才能活
Give up the stone, and she lives.

627
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,900
放开他
Hands off.

628
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,160
快  快
Come on. Come on.

629
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,960
快  你得站起来
Come on, you gotta get up.

630
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,540
你得站起来  快
You gotta get up. Come on.

631
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,960
我们得走了
We have to go.

632
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,220
拜托  你走吧
Please. Please leave.

633
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,880
你让我留下来的
You asked me to stay.

634
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,010
-我要留下  -拜托
- I'm staying. - Please.

635
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,880
-起来  -我起不来
- Get up. - I can't.

636
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,300
我们不想杀你  但我们不会手软的
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

637
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:31,800
过时不候
You'll never get the chance again.

638
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,860
你能站起来吗
Can you stand?

639
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,740
谢谢你  队长
Thank you, Captain.

640
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,530
先扶你上飞机吧
Let's get you on the jet.

641
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,920
我们不是说好了吗
Now, I thought we had a deal.

642
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,520
别走太远  保持联系  不要冒险
Stay close, check in, don't take any chances.

643
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,420
对不起
I'm sorry.

644
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,470
我们只是需要时间
We just wanted time.

645
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,550
去哪里  队长
Where to, Cap?

646
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,430
回家
Home.

647
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,020
我们会安全的  会安全的
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

648
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,480
泽霍贝瑞人
Zehobereians.

649
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,980
母亲  我母亲呢
Mother! Where's my mother?

650
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,900
不选一边就要死
Choose a side or die.

651
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,930
母亲
Mother!

652
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,890
一边是启示
One side is a revelation...

653
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,230
另一边是只有少数人拥有的荣耀
the other an honor known only to a few.

654
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,390
你怎么了  小家伙
What's wrong, little one?

655
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:11,400
我母亲  我母亲在哪
My mother. Where is my mother?

656
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,200
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

657
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,610
我叫卡魔拉
Gamora.

658
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,780
你很有斗志  卡魔拉
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

659
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,290
来
Come.

660
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,000
我来帮你
Let me help you.

661
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,470
你看
Look.

662
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,180
很漂亮是吧
Pretty, isn't it?

663
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,060
平衡感恰到好处  正是一切事物应有的样子
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

664
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,900
左右偏移太多的话...
Too much to one side or the other...

665
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,950
给  你试试
Here. You try.

666
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,370
安详地去见你们的造物主吧
Now, go in peace to meet your maker.

667
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,250
集中注意力
Concentrate.

668
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,470
这就对了  你掌握了
There. You've got it.

669
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,520
卡魔拉
Gamora.

670
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:33,790
你知不知道这些手榴弹
Do you know if these grenades

671
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,500
是炸掉蛋蛋的  还是毒气弹
are the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

672
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,180
因为我想
Because I was thinking about

673
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,360
在皮带上挂几个
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

674
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,250
但我可不想被炸...
But I don't want to if they're the...

675
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,700
我需要你帮忙
I need to ask a favor.

676
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,660
当然
Yeah, sure.

677
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,430
不管怎样
One way or another,

678
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,910
我们都会与灭霸交手的
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

679
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,710
这就是手榴弹的用处
Which is what the grenades are for.

680
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,840
抱歉  你要我帮什么忙
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

681
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:58,960
如果事情出了岔子
If things go wrong...

682
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,430
如果灭霸抓到了我
If Thanos gets me...

683
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,850
我要你答应我
I want you to promise me...

684
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,100
你会杀了我
you'll kill me.

685
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,810
什么
What?

686
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,480
我知道一些他不知道的事
I know something he doesn't.

687
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:22,570
如果他知道了
And if he finds it out,

688
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,380
那整个宇宙都有危险了
the entire universe could be at risk.

689
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,510
你知道什么
What do you know?

690
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,370
如果我告诉你  你也知道了
If I tell you, you'd know too.

691
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,410
如果这事如此重要
If it's so important...

692
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,620
难道我不该知道吗
shouldn't I?

693
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:35,930
除非你想死
Only if you wanna die.

694
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,170
为什么总有人要死
Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

695
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,000
你就
Just...

696
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,550
相信我  可能还要杀了我
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

697
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,070
我倒是愿意
I mean, I'd like to.

698
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,010
真的  但是你...
I really would. But you...

699
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,390
向我发誓
Swear to me.

700
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,690
以你母亲的名义向我发誓
Swear to me on your mother.

701
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,360
好
Okay.

702
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,120
好吧
Okay.

703
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:29,990
老兄
Dude.

704
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,560
你在那里站了多久
How long have you been standing there?

705
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,640
一小时
An hour.

706
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,020
一小时
An hour?

707
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:36,020
你不是吧
Are you serious?

708
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,060
我已经掌握了
I've mastered the ability

709
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,360
纹丝不动站立的能力
of standing so incredibly still...

710
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,690
肉眼是看不到我的
that I become invisible to the eye.

711
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,490
看好了
Watch.

712
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,120
你在吃花生糖呢
You're eating a zarg-nut.

713
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,750
但是我的动作
But my movement...

714
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,210
如此缓慢
was so slow...

715
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,770
令人难以察觉
that it's imperceptible.

716
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,420
不是
Mmm, no.

717
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,850
我坚信没人能看到我
I'm sure I'm invisible.

718
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:04,300
德拉克斯
Hi, Drax.

719
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,630
该死的
Damn it.

720
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,320
这地方似乎已经荒废了
This place looks deserted.

721
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:32,260
第三象限有动静
I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

722
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,200
没错  我也看到了
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

723
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,250
我们在这里降落吧
Let's put down right here.

724
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,180
东西不在我这里
I don't have it.

725
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,280
银河系的人都知道
Everyone in the galaxy knows

726
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,120
你愿出卖亲兄弟
you'd sell your own brother...

727
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,740
来为你可悲的收藏
if you thought it would add even the slightest trinket

728
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,600
增添一点小装饰品
to your pathetic collection.

729
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,360
我知道现实宝石在你手上  蒂万
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

730
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,530
把宝石交给我  你就不必遭受折磨
Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

731
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,000
我和你说了
I told you.

732
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,420
我卖掉了
I sold it.

733
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,980
我为什么要骗你
Why would I lie?

734
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,420
我想骗人是你的天性
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

735
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,020
那是自杀
Like suicide.

736
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,930
看来你明白啊
You do understand.

737
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,310
就算是你也不会交出如此宝贵的东西
Not even you would surrender something so precious.

738
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,340
我当时并不知道它是什么
I didn't know what it was.

739
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,910
那你比我想的还蠢
Then you're more of a fool than I took you for.

740
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,030
是他
It's him.

741
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,990
最后的机会  你这骗子
Last chance, charlatan.

742
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,000
宝石呢
Where's the stone?

743
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:48,530
今天
Today...

744
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:49,950
德拉克斯
Drax. Drax.

745
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:52,380
他要为我妻女的死付出代价
...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

746
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,630
德拉克斯  等等
Drax, wait.

747
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,210
别急  别急
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

748
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,190
德拉克斯
Drax.

749
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,770
德拉克斯  听我说
Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

750
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,830
他还没拿到宝石
He doesn't have the stone yet.

751
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,600
如果我们拿到宝石  就能阻止他
If we get it, then we can stop him.

752
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,750
我们得先拿到宝石  没错
We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

753
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:12,850
不
No.

754
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,530
不  为了奥薇特  为了卡玛莉亚
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

755
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,220
睡吧
Sleep.

756
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,110
好吧
Okay.

757
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:35,660
卡魔拉  螳螂  你们去右边
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

758
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,260
另一个右边
The other right.

759
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:03,850
为什么
Why?

760
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:17,470
为什么是你  女儿
Why you, daughter?

761
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:37,810
好快啊
That was quick.

762
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,400
了不起  了不起  了不起
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

763
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,610
你难过了吗  女儿
Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?

764
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,070
我心里知道  你依然在乎我
In my heart, I knew you still cared.

765
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,780
但毕竟没法确定
But one never knows for sure.

766
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,430
现实往往令人失望
Reality is often disappointing.

767
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:26,840
至少以前是的
That is, it was.

768
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,010
现在
Now...

769
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,460
现实可以任我摆布了
reality can be whatever I want.

770
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,210
你早知道我会来
You knew I'd come.

771
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,040
我就指望着呢
I counted on it.

772
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,300
我们需要谈谈  小家伙
There's something we need to discuss, little one.

773
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,210
灭霸
Thanos!

774
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,970
不
No!

775
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,990
放了她  奶昔大哥
Let her go, Grimace.

776
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,340
彼得
Peter.

777
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,200
我叫你走右边的
I told you to go right.

778
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,970
现在还说这个
Now? Really?

779
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,360
你放了她
You let her go!

780
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,890
你是那个男友
Ah, the boyfriend.

781
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,690
不
No.

782
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,300
我更喜欢自视为
Like to think of myself more as a

783
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,040
杀泰坦的长期炮友
Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

784
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,120
-放了她  -彼得
- Let her go. - Peter.

785
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,940
否则我轰掉你阴囊一样的下巴
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.

786
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,310
不是他
Not him.

787
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,720
你答应过我  你答应了
You promised. You promised.

788
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,490
女儿
Oh, daughter.

789
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,890
你对他提的要求他做不到
You expect too much from him.

790
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,890
她跟你提过了  是吧
She's asked, hasn't she?

791
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,290
动手吧
Do it.

792
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:08,840
动手
Do it!

793
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,670
我叫你走右边的
I told you to go right.

794
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,750
我爱你超过一切
I love you more than anything.

795
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,850
我也爱你
I love you too.

796
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,660
我喜欢他
I like him.

797
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,780
幻视还没消息吗
Still no word from Vision?

798
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,780
卫星在爱丁堡附近跟丢了他
Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

799
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,420
驾驶盗走的昆式战斗机
On a stolen Quinjet

800
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,760
还有四个全球头号通缉犯
with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

801
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,980
你知道他们是"罪犯"
You know they're only criminals

802
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,050
只是因为你非要那么称呼他们
because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

803
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:25,970
天呐  罗德
My God, Rhodes.

804
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:29,460
你鬼扯的本事能跟我有一拼了
Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

805
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,840
要不是因为《协议》
If it weren't for those Accords,

806
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,760
幻视根本不会走
Vision would've been right here.

807
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,390
我记得你也签了那份文件  中校
I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

808
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,730
是啊
That's right.

809
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,680
我也为此付出了代价
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

810
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,350
你后悔了吗
You have second thoughts?

811
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,540
现在没了
Not anymore.

812
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:51,990
国务卿先生
Mr. Secretary.

813
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,630
你好大胆
You got some nerve.

814
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,330
这我承认
I'll give you that.

815
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,810
你现在正需要点胆呢
You could use some of that right now.

816
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,560
世界有危险了
The world's on fire.

817
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,010
你觉得一切都被原谅了吗
And you think all is forgiven?

818
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,990
我想要的不是原谅
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

819
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,160
我更不想征求同意了
And I'm way past asking permission.

820
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,180
地球刚失去了最好的守卫者
Earth just lost her best defender.

821
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,070
我们是来战斗的
So we're here to fight.

822
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,270
如果你想挡路
And if you wanna stand in our way...

823
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,790
我们连你一起打
we'll fight you too.

824
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
逮捕他们
Arrest them.

825
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,970
这就去
All over it.

826
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:39,990
得上军事法庭了
That's a court-martial.

827
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,830
见到你真高兴  队长
It's great to see you, Cap.

828
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,630
你也是  罗德
You too, Rhodey.

829
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,150
你们
You guys...

830
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,280
看上去状况真差
really look like crap.

831
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,670
这几年很辛苦吧
Must've been a rough couple years.

832
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:58,650
是啊  没怎么住五星酒店
Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

833
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,990
我觉得你们看上去很棒
I think you look great.

834
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:09,470
是啊  我回来了
Yeah, I'm back.

835
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:12,830
你好啊  布鲁斯
Hi, Bruce.

836
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:19,210
小娜
Nat.

837
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:24,180
好尴尬
This is awkward.

838
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,740
那他们还会再回来吧
So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

839
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,990
他们显然能找到我们
And they can clearly find us.

840
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,130
我们得全体出动  克林特呢
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

841
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,700
《协议》的事后
After the whole Accords situation,

842
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,450
他和斯科特做了协议
he and Scott took a deal.

843
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:37,340
他们的家人承受不了  所以他们被软禁在家了
It was too tough on their families. They're on house arrest.

844
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,650
-斯科特是谁  -蚁人
- Who's Scott? - Ant-Man.

845
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,570
有蚁人还有蜘蛛侠
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

846
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,180
好吧
Okay, look.

847
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,300
灭霸有全宇宙最大的军队
Thanos has the biggest army in the universe...

848
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,910
他不会罢休的  除非他得到
and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

849
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:51,780
幻视的宝石
Vision's stone.

850
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,150
那我们得保护它
Then we have to protect it.

851
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,980
不  我们得毁掉它
No, we have to destroy it.

852
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,490
我好好想过了
I've been giving a good deal of thought

853
00:56:58,490 --> 00:56:59,690
我脑袋上的这东西
to this entity in my head.

854
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:01,490
关于它的性质
About its nature.

855
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,950
以及它的组成
But also its composition.

856
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,750
我觉得如果它遭遇
I think if it were exposed

857
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,260
足够强大的能量源
to a sufficiently powerful energy source...

858
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:12,050
特性类似其本身的能量  那或许
something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...

859
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,850
它的分子完整性就会被破坏
its molecular integrity could fail.

860
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,250
你也会随之被摧毁
Yeah, and you with it.

861
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,550
这不是个选择
We're not having this conversation.

862
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:22,500
只有销毁宝石
Eliminating the stone is the only way

863
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,690
才能确保灭霸拿不到它
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

864
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,380
那代价太高了
That's too high a price.

865
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,650
只有你有能力付出这代价
Only you have the power to pay it.

866
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,670
灭霸威胁宇宙一半的生命
Thanos threatens half the universe.

867
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,180
不能让一人的生命阻碍战胜他的希望
One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

868
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,560
这样不对
But it should.

869
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,300
我们不以命换命  幻视
We don't trade lives, Vision.

870
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,140
队长  70年前  你付出生命
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...

871
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,720
来挽救了多少人
to save how many millions of people?

872
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,820
告诉我  这有什么不同
Tell me, why is this any different?

873
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:57,670
因为  你可能还有选择
Because you might have a choice.

874
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,040
你的心灵是由
Your mind is made up

875
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:02,740
许多东西叠加而成的
of a complex construct of overlays.

876
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:06,430
贾维斯  奥创  托尼  我  宝石
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

877
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:08,270
他们混在了一起
All of them mixed together,

878
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,160
彼此学习
all of them learning from one another.

879
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,100
你是说幻视并不只是那块宝石
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

880
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,040
我是说  如果我们取出宝石
I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

881
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,000
还剩下不少的幻视
there's still a whole lot of Vision left.

882
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,590
或许还是最好的部分
Perhaps the best parts.

883
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,760
这能做到吗
Can we do that?

884
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:21,990
我在这里是不行
Not me, not here.

885
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,280
那你最好赶紧找到
Well, you better find someone

886
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,750
合适的地方和人
and somewhere fast.

887
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,880
罗斯可不会让你们
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys

888
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,490
再回老房间住
have your old rooms back.

889
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,450
我知道个地方
I know somewhere.

890
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:48,570
御林护卫
The Kingsguard

891
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,660
和女子皇家护卫队都已得到通知
and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

892
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,890
边境部落呢
And the Border Tribe?

893
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,680
还剩的都通知了
Those that are left.

894
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,350
派人传话去贾巴里
Send word to the Jabari as well.

895
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,730
姆巴库就喜欢好好打一场
M'Baku likes a good fight.

896
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,070
他呢
And what of this one?

897
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,420
他可能已经厌倦了战争
This one may be tired of war.

898
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,660
但白狼已经休息够久了
But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

899
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,530
哪里要打仗了
Where's the fight?

900
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,060
他们就来
On its way.

901
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,360
我为灭霸效力这么久
In all the time I've served Thanos...

902
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,810
从未让他失望过
I have never failed him.

903
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:08,070
如果我赶到了我们泰坦星的汇合点
If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...

904
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,080
而时间宝石还连在
with the Time Stone still attached

905
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,200
你这讨厌鬼身上
to your vaguely irritating person...

906
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,990
我会受到  责罚的
there would be judgment.

907
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,750
给我
Give me...

908
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:30,500
宝石
the stone.

909
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,220
你还真是件忠心耿耿的外套啊
You're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

910
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,210
说到忠诚
Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

911
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,080
什么...
What the...

912
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,770
-我知道你要说什么  -你不该在这儿的
- I know what you're gonna say. - You should not be here.

913
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:51,910
-我本想回家的  -我不想听
- I was gonna go home. - I don't wanna hear it.

914
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:52,950
但下去的路好远啊
But it was such a long way down

915
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:53,750
我路上就在想你
and I just thought about you on the way...

916
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,460
你还说上了
And now I gotta hear it.

917
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:55,710
然后我就卡在飞船边上了
...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

918
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:58,340
这件战衣的直觉特别准
And this suit is ridiculously intuitive,

919
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:58,840
-真的  -该死
- by the way. - God damn it.

920
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,550
所以如果要说  我在这儿其实怪你
So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

921
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,630
-你说什么  -我收回
- What did you just say? - I take that back.

922
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,010
现在  我在外太空里了
And now, I'm here in space.

923
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,450
是啊  在我不想要你在的地方
Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

924
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,990
这里不是科尼岛  不是学校出游
This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip.

925
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,270
这可是有去无回
This is a one-way ticket.

926
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:13,200
听到了吗  别假装你都想清楚了
You hear me? Don't pretend you thought this through.

927
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:13,990
-不  我想清楚了  -你肯定没有
- No, I did think this through. - I know you didn't.

928
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:15,670
你根本不可能想清楚了
You could not have possibly thought this through.

929
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,410
我想当个友好邻居蜘蛛侠
You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...

930
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:18,810
但没有邻居了还怎么做
if there's no neighborhood.

931
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,160
好吧  这话不是很通
Okay, that didn't really make sense,

932
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:23,530
但你明白我想说什么
but you know what I'm trying to say.

933
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,070
好了  还有情况要处理呢
Come on. We got a situation.

934
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:30,720
看到下面那个了吗  他有麻烦了
See him down there? He's in trouble.

935
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,650
你有什么计划
What's your plan?

936
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:32,640
说吧
Go.

937
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:34,780
好吧
Okay, okay...

938
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:38,290
好吧  你看过一部特老的电影《异形》吗
Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

939
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,220
疼吧  是不是
Painful, aren't they?

940
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,940
原本是用来做显微手术的
They were originally designed for microsurgery.

941
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:50,360
任何一个
And any one of them...

942
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:58,510
都能瞬间杀死你的朋友
could end your friend's life in an instant.

943
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:00,450
我得告诉你  他算不上是我的朋友
I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.

944
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,410
救他命更多是职业上的礼貌
Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.

945
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,370
你什么都没救
You've saved nothing.

946
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,890
你的力量跟我比微不足道
Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.

947
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:13,490
是啊  但那孩子看的电影多
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

948
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:29,900
棒啊  等等  这是什么
Yes! Wait. What are those?

949
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,720
我们还没正式介绍过呢
Hey, we haven't officially met.

950
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:48,780
好吧
Cool.

951
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,590
我们得调头回去
We gotta turn this ship around.

952
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,680
是啊  他现在想跑了
Yeah, now he wants to run.

953
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,610
-好计划  -我想保护宝石
- Great plan. - No, I want to protect the stone.

954
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,600
我还想要你谢我呢
And I want you to thank me.

955
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,310
说吧  我听着呢
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

956
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,390
谢什么  差点把我轰进太空里吗
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

957
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,720
刚是谁救了你个魔法师  是我
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

958
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,310
真不知道你这么膨胀的脑袋怎么塞得进头盔里
I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.

959
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:09,600
承认吧  你早该听我的躲起来
Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.

960
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,380
我让你别插手的  你不肯
I tried to bench you. You refused.

961
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,370
不像你人生中的其他所有人  我不为你工作
Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

962
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:14,930
因为这个
And due to that fact,

963
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:16,510
我们现在在一艘飞行甜甜圈上
we're now in a flying doughnut...

964
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,410
离地球十万八千里  还没有后援
billions of miles from Earth with no backup.

965
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,410
-我是后援  -不  你是偷渡的
- I'm backup. - No, you're a stowaway.

966
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,550
大人说话呢
The adults are talking.

967
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,360
抱歉  我搞不懂你们什么关系
I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here.

968
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,190
他是你的养子吗
What is he, your ward?

969
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,180
不是
No.

970
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,660
-我是彼得  -斯特兰奇博士[奇异博士]
- I'm Peter, by the way. - Doctor Strange.

971
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:31,220
你在用诨号吗
You're using our made-up names.

972
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,730
那我是蜘蛛侠
I'm Spider-Man, then.

973
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,370
这艘船在自我纠正航线
This ship is self-correcting its course.

974
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:37,370
它在自动驾驶
Thing's on autopilot.

975
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,500
我们能控制它吗
Can we control it?

976
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,180
飞回家
Fly us home?

977
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:45,090
-斯塔克  -嗯
- Stark? - Yeah.

978
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,420
你能带我们回家吗
Can you get us home?

979
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:47,690
我听到了
Yeah, I heard you.

980
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,190
我在想  或许我们不该回去
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

981
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:53,780
我们决不能
Under no circumstances

982
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:56,330
把时间宝石送去灭霸那里
can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

983
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,030
你恐怕还不明白
I don't think you quite understand

984
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,310
-事情的严重性吧  -什么  不
- what's at stake here. - What? No.

985
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:01,590
是你不明白
It's you who doesn't understand...

986
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:04,450
灭霸萦绕我的脑海六年了
that Thanos has been inside my head for six years.

987
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:05,980
自从他派了支军队去纽约
Since he sent an army to New York

988
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,150
现在他又回来了
and now he's back.

989
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,220
我不知道该怎么办
And I don't know what to do.

990
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:11,110
所以我不能确定
So I'm not so sure

991
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,060
是该在我们的地盘还是他的地盘跟他打
if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...

992
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:16,310
但你看到了他们做的事  看到了他们能做什么
but you saw what they did, what they can do.

993
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:19,020
至少去他的地盘  还能出其不意
At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

994
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,530
我说  我们打上门去
So I say we take the fight to him.

995
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,160
博士
Doctor.

996
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:25,970
你同意吗
Do you concur?

997
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,790
好吧  斯塔克  我们去找他
All right, Stark. We go to him.

998
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,240
但你要明白
But you have to understand...

999
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,600
如果我要选择救你
if it comes to saving you

1000
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,050
那孩子  或是时间宝石
or the kid or the Time Stone...

1001
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,230
我会毫不犹豫地任你们死去
I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

1002
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,810
我必须如此  因为这事关宇宙的命运
I can't, because the universe depends on it.

1003
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:50,230
好  好三观
Nice. Good, moral compass.

1004
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,160
我们没问题了
We're straight.

1005
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,620
好吧  小子
All right, kid.

1006
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,090
你是复仇者了
You're an Avenger now.

1007
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,150
我觉得你可能饿了
I thought you might be hungry.

1008
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,840
我一直讨厌那椅子
I always hated that chair.

1009
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,340
我听说了
So I've been told.

1010
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:57,080
即便如此  我还是希望有天你能坐上去
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

1011
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,520
我讨厌这个房间
I hated this room.

1012
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,440
这艘飞船
This ship.

1013
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,440
我讨厌我曾经的生活
I hated my life.

1014
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,580
这你也跟我说过
You told me that too.

1015
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,630
每天都说
Every day.

1016
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,730
说了将近20年
For almost 20 years.

1017
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,440
你带走我时  我还是孩子
I was a child when you took me.

1018
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:26,780
我救了你
I saved you.

1019
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,060
不
No.

1020
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,310
不  我们在母星上时  本来很幸福
No. We were happy on my home planet.

1021
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:37,890
饿着肚子睡觉
Going to bed hungry...

1022
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,230
到处找残羹冷炙
scrounging for scraps.

1023
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,980
你的星球当时已濒临崩溃
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.

1024
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,840
是我阻止了那发生
I'm the one who stopped that.

1025
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,520
你知道它后来怎么样了吗
Do you know what's happened since then?

1026
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,210
新生的孩子
The children born...

1027
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,590
都能吃饱肚子  看到清澈的天空
have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.

1028
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,330
那里成了天堂
It's a paradise.

1029
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,380
因为你杀了半个星球的人
Because you murdered half the planet.

1030
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,420
为得到拯救  这只是小小代价
A small price to pay for salvation.

1031
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,560
你疯了
You're insane.

1032
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,760
小家伙  这只是简单的数学
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

1033
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,050
宇宙是有限的  资源也是有限的
This universe is finite, its resources finite.

1034
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:13,120
如果生命不加以控制  就会消亡
If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.

1035
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,440
它需要纠正
It needs correction.

1036
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,580
这你怎么知道
You don't know that!

1037
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,230
只有我知道这个道理
I'm the only one who knows that.

1038
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:24,570
至少  只有我愿意为此采取行动
At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

1039
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,430
曾经
For a time...

1040
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,230
你也有那样的意愿
you had that same will...

1041
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:38,180
与我一同战斗
as you fought by my side.

1042
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:39,820
女儿
Daughter.

1043
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,320
我不是你的女儿
I'm not your daughter.

1044
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:47,730
我恨自己的一切都是你教的
Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

1045
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,000
而你因此
And, in doing so,

1046
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,550
也成了银河系里最威猛的女人
made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

1047
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:58,080
所以我派你去寻找灵魂宝石
That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

1048
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,770
抱歉我让你失望了
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1049
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,030
我是失望
I am disappointed.

1050
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:10,150
但不是因为你没找到
But not because you didn't find it.

1051
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,950
是因为你找到了
But because you did.

1052
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:18,720
但你却撒谎了
And you lied.

1053
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,420
星云
Nebula.

1054
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,570
别这样
Don't do this.

1055
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:47,120
一段时间之前
Some time ago,

1056
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,150
你妹妹溜上船来杀我
your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

1057
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,450
求你别这样
Please don't do this.

1058
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,590
还差点成功了
And very nearly succeeded.

1059
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,850
所以我把她带来了这里
So I brought her here.

1060
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:58,570
好跟她谈谈
To talk.

1061
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,530
住手  住手
Stop. Stop it.

1062
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:16,860
我以生命起誓
I swear to you on my life.

1063
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,470
我没找到灵魂宝石
I never found the Soul Stone.

1064
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:25,490
读取记忆文件
Accessing memory files.

1065
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:26,950
你知道他要做什么
You know what he's about to do.

1066
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,720
他总算准备好了  他要去找宝石
He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones.

1067
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,090
-所有宝石  -他不可能得到所有宝石
- All of them. - He can never get them all.

1068
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:31,940
他会的
He will!

1069
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,840
他不能  星云
He can't, Nebula.

1070
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,530
因为我找到了灵魂宝石的地图
Because I found the map to the Soul Stone...

1071
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,600
然后把它烧成了灰  我把它烧了
and I burned it to ash. I burned it.

1072
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,320
你很强壮
You're strong.

1073
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,460
这是我教的
Me.

1074
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,490
你很慷慨
You're generous.

1075
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,990
这是我教的
Me.

1076
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,130
但我可没教过你撒谎
But I never taught you to lie.

1077
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,860
所以你很不擅长
That's why you're so bad at it.

1078
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:09,990
灵魂宝石在哪
Where is the Soul Stone?

1079
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:28,550
沃密尔星球
Vormir!

1080
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,040
宝石在沃密尔
The stone is on Vormir.

1081
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,550
带我去
Show me.

1082
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:56,960
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1083
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,130
在杯子里尿
Tinkle in the cup.

1084
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:59,660
我们不看  有什么可看的
We're not looking. What's there to see?

1085
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,990
小树枝是什么  谁都见过小树枝
What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig before.

1086
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,870
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1087
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,170
树人  把杯子里的东西
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1088
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:06,300
倒进太空里  然后再用杯子
out into space and go in the cup again.

1089
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:07,430
你会格鲁特语
You speak Groot?

1090
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,610
阿斯加德教这个  选修课
Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

1091
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:10,790
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1092
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,700
等我们快到了你会知道的
You'll know when we're close.

1093
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,340
尼德威阿尔的锻炉汲取
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1094
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,810
一颗中子星的炙热能量
the blazing power of a neutron star.

1095
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:21,560
我的锤子就是在那里铸造的
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

1096
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,690
可赞了
It's truly awesome.

1097
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,120
好吧  该拿出船长的样子了
Okay, time to be the captain.

1098
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,920
弟弟死了啊
So, dead brother, huh?

1099
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:42,030
嗯  那是挺烦人的
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1100
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,360
他以前也死过
Well, he's been dead before.

1101
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,810
但这次可能是真的了
But, no, this time I think it really might be true.

1102
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,690
你说你还有姐姐和爸爸
And you said your sister and your dad?

1103
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:52,690
都死了
Both dead.

1104
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,310
还有妈妈吧
But still got a mom, though?

1105
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,270
被黑暗精灵杀了
Killed by a dark elf.

1106
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,430
最好朋友呢
A best friend?

1107
01:11:58,430 --> 01:11:59,860
利刃穿心而死
Stabbed through the heart.

1108
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,100
你真想执行这趟杀人任务吗
You sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

1109
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:09,640
非常想
Absolutely.

1110
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:13,930
愤怒  复仇  怒火  失去  后悔
Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

1111
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,240
都是很好的动力
they're all tremendous motivators.

1112
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,730
让人脑袋很清醒
They really clear the mind.

1113
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:18,350
我没问题的
So I'm good to go.

1114
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,710
是啊  但这个灭霸
Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...

1115
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,920
他可是最厉害的
he's the toughest there is.

1116
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,140
-他是没打过我  -他打过的
- Well, he's never fought me. - Yeah, he has.

1117
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,660
他没打过我两次
He's never fought me twice.

1118
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,490
别忘了  我还要去铸把新锤子
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

1119
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:32,310
这锤子最好厉害
It better be some hammer.

1120
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:39,100
我1500岁了
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1121
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:42,070
我杀过的敌人是我岁数的一倍
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

1122
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:44,040
他们每个人都想杀死我
And every one of them would've rather killed me,

1123
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:45,530
但没人成功过
but none succeeded.

1124
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,520
我还活着是因为命运希望我活着
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

1125
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:51,840
灭霸只是又一个这样的混蛋
Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...

1126
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,630
而他会是又一个我复仇的对象
and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.

1127
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,520
这是命运的意愿
Fate wills it so.

1128
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,550
如果你错了呢
And what if you're wrong?

1129
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,710
如果我错了
If I'm wrong, then...

1130
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,750
那我还有什么可失去的呢
what more could I lose?

1131
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,860
我可以失去很多
I could lose a lot.

1132
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,810
我个人而言可以失去很多呢
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

1133
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:28,980
好吧
Okay.

1134
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:34,290
如果命运真希望你杀了那混球
If fate does want you to kill that crapsack...

1135
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,320
你会需要不止一颗眼球
you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

1136
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,200
-这是什么  -你说呢
- What's this? - What's it look like?

1137
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:41,330
康特西亚星球上一个混蛋打赌输给我的
Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

1138
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,520
他把眼睛给你了
He gave you his eye?

1139
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,890
不  他给了我100信用点
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1140
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,700
我那晚稍后溜进了他房里偷走了他的眼睛
I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.

1141
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,440
谢谢  好兔子
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1142
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,780
你该洗洗的
I would've washed that.

1143
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,870
我唯一能把它从康特西亚偷出来的办法就是塞进我
The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...

1144
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,470
我们到了
Hey, we're here!

1145
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,210
这玩意好像不好使
I don't think this thing works.

1146
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:12,590
怎么暗乎乎的
Everything seems dark.

1147
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:16,270
不是眼睛的问题
It ain't the eye.

1148
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:31,110
情况不对
Something's wrong.

1149
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,640
中子星熄灭了
The star's gone out.

1150
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,340
环也冻住了
And the rings are frozen.

1151
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,260
希望这些矮人
I hope these dwarves

1152
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,610
铸造的本事比打扫强
are better at forging than they are cleaning.

1153
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,650
或许他们是意识到
Maybe they realized that

1154
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:09,070
自己住在太空里的一个垃圾堆里
they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.

1155
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,810
这个锻炉几世纪都没熄过火了
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1156
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,180
你说灭霸有个手套  是吧
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1157
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,450
对  怎么
Yes, why?

1158
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,280
像那样的吗
It look anything like that?

1159
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:25,590
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1160
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,960
回飞行舱去
Go back to the pod.

1161
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:32,820
伊特里  等等
Eitri, wait!

1162
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,180
住手
Stop!

1163
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,180
住手
Stop.

1164
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,170
托尔
Thor?

1165
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,670
这里发生了什么
What happened here?

1166
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:45,650
你本该保护我们的
You were supposed to protect us.

1167
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:49,160
阿斯加德本该保护我们的
Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1168
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:51,550
阿斯加德被毁了
Asgard is destroyed.

1169
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:57,150
伊特里  手套  你做了什么
Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1170
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:13,000
环上住了300个矮人
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1171
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,610
我以为如果我听从他的命令  他们就会安全
I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.

1172
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,700
我造出了他要的东西
I made what he wanted.

1173
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:27,570
一件能汲取宝石力量的装置
A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.

1174
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:34,130
然后他还是杀了所有人
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1175
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:38,300
除了我
All except me.

1176
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,740
"你的命属于你"  他说
"Your life is yours," He said.

1177
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:46,850
"但你的手  属于我"
"But your hands are mine alone."

1178
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,840
伊特里  你的手不是重点
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1179
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,480
你设计的每一件武器
Every weapon you've ever designed,

1180
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,040
每把斧子  锤子  剑
every axe, hammer, sword...

1181
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:56,210
都在你脑袋里
it's all inside your head.

1182
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:59,140
我知道你现在觉得希望尽失
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

1183
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:00,310
相信我  我知道
Trust me, I know.

1184
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:05,900
但你我联手  我们能杀了灭霸
But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

1185
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:48,680
螳螂  听好了
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1186
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,890
我需要你去泰坦星见我
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1187
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:58,560
怎么了
Hey, what's going on?

1188
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:00,460
我们好像到了
I think we're here.

1189
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,730
这玩意恐怕没有自动停车功能
I don't think this rig has a self-park function.

1190
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,360
把手伸到方向装置里
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.

1191
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,530
把这个合上
Close those around it.

1192
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,650
-懂吗  -好的
- You understand? - Yep, got it.

1193
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,030
这是给一个大块头准备的
This was meant for one big guy,

1194
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:13,510
-我们动作得同步  -好的  好了
- so we gotta move at the same time. - Okay, okay. Ready.

1195
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:18,920
我们最好转向
We might wanna turn.

1196
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:20,590
转向  转向啊
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1197
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:50,720
你没事吧
You all right?

1198
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,180
好悬啊
That was close.

1199
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,670
我欠你的
I owe you one.

1200
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,330
我想说  如果外星人
Let me just say, if aliens

1201
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,710
在我胸腔里植入了卵什么的
wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...

1202
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:02,730
而我吃掉了你们谁  那我很抱歉
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1203
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:05,390
余下的时间里不许你
I do not want another single pop culture reference

1204
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:06,750
再提流行文化梗了  懂吗
out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

1205
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,630
我是想说  有东西过来了
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1206
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,300
灭霸
Thanos!

1207
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:39,700
拜托别把你的卵放进我身体里
Please don't put your eggs in me!

1208
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,100
别动  小丑
Stay down, clown.

1209
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,410
死吧  死亡毯子
Die, blanket of death!

1210
01:19:56,980 --> 01:20:00,230
都别动  都给我冷静
Everybody stay where you are. Chill the eff out.

1211
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:02,910
我就问你一次
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1212
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,960
卡魔拉呢
Where is Gamora?

1213
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,780
我问你个更好的  卡魔拉是谁
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

1214
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:10,850
我问你个更好的  为什么卡魔拉
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

1215
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:12,780
告诉我她在哪  否则我发誓
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you

1216
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,130
我会把这小怪物烧焦的
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1217
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:17,270
来吧  你打我的人  我打你的人  来吧
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1218
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,450
动手吧  奎尔  我承受得住
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1219
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:21,520
不  他承受不住
No, he can't take it!

1220
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,450
她说得对  你承受不住
She's right. You can't.

1221
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,810
是吗  你不告诉我她在哪吗  好啊
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine.

1222
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:26,000
我杀了你们三个
I'll kill all three of you

1223
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,170
然后揍到灭霸开口
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1224
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:29,080
从你开始
Starting with you.

1225
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,190
等等  灭霸
Wait, what, Thanos?

1226
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:32,530
好吧  我问你个问题
All right, let me ask you this one time.

1227
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:34,860
你效忠哪位主人
What master do you serve?

1228
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,930
我效忠哪位主人
What master do I serve?

1229
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,860
怎么  我该说"耶稣"吗
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1230
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,630
你是地球人
You're from Earth.

1231
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:40,570
我不是地球人  我是密苏里人
I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

1232
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,080
那就是地球  白痴
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1233
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,030
你打我们干什么
What are you hassling us for?

1234
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,940
你们不是灭霸的人
So you're not with Thanos?

1235
01:20:45,670 --> 01:20:47,460
灭霸的人
With Thanos?

1236
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,660
不  我是来杀灭霸的
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1237
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,730
他带走了我女人  等等  你们是谁
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

1238
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:55,050
我们是复仇者  哥们
We're the Avengers, man.

1239
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,650
你们是托尔说的人
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1240
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:58,850
你们认识托尔
You know Thor?

1241
01:20:59,100 --> 01:20:59,800
是啊
Yeah.

1242
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:03,020
高个  长得不咋样  还需要别人救
Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

1243
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,060
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

1244
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,480
这就是你的计划  用砖头拍他
This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1245
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,760
这是模具
It's a mold.

1246
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,060
国王的武器
A king's weapon.

1247
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:27,770
本该是阿斯加德最强大的
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1248
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:31,550
理论上  它甚至能召唤彩虹桥
In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

1249
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:32,740
它有名字吗
Did it have a name?

1250
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,560
风暴斧
Stormbreaker.

1251
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,250
有点过了
That's a bit much.

1252
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,330
要怎么打造它
So how do we make it?

1253
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,010
你得重启锻炉
You'll have to restart the forge.

1254
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:47,510
唤醒濒死恒星的核心
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1255
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:52,580
兔子  启动飞行舱
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1256
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,190
这星球遭遇了什么
The hell happened to this planet?

1257
01:21:58,450 --> 01:22:00,210
偏离自转轴八度
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1258
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:02,750
引力到处都是
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1259
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:06,620
我们有一个优势  他会自己来
Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.

1260
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:08,640
我们要利用这一点
We'll use it.

1261
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,450
好了  我有个计划
All right, I have a plan.

1262
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,840
至少有个大致轮廓
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1263
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,150
非常简单  我们引他过来
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,

1264
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:14,590
把他打趴下  拿到需要的东西
pin him down, get what we need.

1265
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:16,000
我可不想跟他纠缠[陪他跳舞]
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.

1266
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,700
我们只想拿手套
We just want the gauntlet.

1267
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:19,350
你打哈欠
Are you yawning?

1268
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,440
我讲解计划的时候你竟然打哈欠
In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down?

1269
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:24,070
你听见我说的了吗
Did you hear what I said?

1270
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:26,910
你说"我们需要计划"之后我就没在听了
I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

1271
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:28,420
好吧  他沉浸在自己的世界里
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1272
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,880
他们一般不会"不随机应变"
See, "Not winging it" isn't really what they do.

1273
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,970
那他们都会什么
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

1274
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:34,660
打仇恨  拉群架
Kick names, take ass.

1275
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:35,760
没错
Yeah, that's right.

1276
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,280
好了  请各位都过来
All right, just get over here, please.

1277
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:46,470
爵先生  能不能让你的伙伴们围过来
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

1278
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:48,560
别爵先生  叫我星爵就好
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1279
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:52,650
我们得联合起来
We gotta coalesce.

1280
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:54,610
因为如果我们只凭一腔勇气去面对他
'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...

1281
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:57,120
哥们  别说什么一腔勇气
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1282
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,610
我们不知道那是什么意思
We don't know what it means.

1283
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,360
我们很乐观  我喜欢你的计划
All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.

1284
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,020
只不过它烂透了  让我来做计划
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

1285
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:06,030
这样就完美无缺了
and that way it might be really good.

1286
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:08,170
告诉他你斗舞拯救宇宙的事
Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

1287
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:10,290
-什么斗舞  -不值一提
- What dance-off? - It's nothing.

1288
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,550
就像那部电影《浑身是劲》一样
Like in Footloose, the movie?

1289
01:23:11,550 --> 01:23:12,980
就是《浑身是劲》那样
Exactly like Footloose.

1290
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,420
它依然是史上最棒的电影吗
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1291
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:16,480
从来都不是
It never was.

1292
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,750
别打岔  好不好
Don't encourage this, all right?

1293
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:18,900
-好  -这位飞侠哥顿
- Okay. - We're getting no help

1294
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,600
-帮不上我们什么  -《飞侠哥顿》
- from Flash Gordon here. - Flash Gordon?

1295
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,580
那可是在夸我哦
By the way, that's a compliment.

1296
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,160
别忘了  我有一半人类血统
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1297
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,110
也就是说我有一半的蠢
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1298
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:28,120
而你是百分百的蠢
that's 100% you.

1299
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,640
我真佩服你数学这么好
Your math is blowing my mind.

1300
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,680
打扰一下
Excuse me.

1301
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,310
你的朋友经常那样吗
But does your friend often do that?

1302
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:38,660
斯特兰奇  没事吧
Strange, we all right?

1303
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:50,250
你恢复了  你没事
You're back. You're all right.

1304
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:52,390
你刚刚怎么了
Hey, what was that?

1305
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:56,620
我推进了时间  浏览未来的可能性
I went forward in time to view alternate futures.

1306
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:59,960
看即将到来的一战所有可能出现的结果
To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.

1307
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:02,610
你看到了多少种
How many did you see?

1308
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,370
一千四百万六百零五种
14,000,605.

1309
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:07,850
我们赢了几种
How many did we win?

1310
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:13,730
一种
One.

1311
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:38,120
灵魂宝石最好在山上
The stone had better be up there.

1312
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,550
不然你妹妹就完了
For your sister's sake.

1313
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:08,590
欢迎  灭霸  阿拉尔斯之子
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1314
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,050
卡魔拉  灭霸之女
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1315
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,210
你认识我们
You know us?

1316
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:19,560
我被诅咒认识所有来到此地的人
It is my curse to know all who journey here.

1317
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,170
灵魂宝石在哪
Where is the Soul Stone?

1318
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,090
你应该知道
You should know...

1319
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,980
得到它的代价极大
it extracts a terrible price.

1320
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,050
我准备好了
I am prepared.

1321
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,890
我们一开始都这么以为
We all think that at first.

1322
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,550
但我们都错了
We are all wrong.

1323
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,660
你怎么如此熟悉这里
How is it you know this place so well?

1324
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:01,260
上一世我也想找无限宝石
A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1325
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,220
甚至曾把一个攥在手里过
I even held one in my hand.

1326
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:08,490
但它把我流放到这里
But it cast me out, banished me here.

1327
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:12,960
指引别人寻找我无法拥有的珍宝
Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

1328
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:24,670
你所寻找的就在你面前
What you seek lies in front of you.

1329
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,190
你所害怕的也在那里
As does what you fear.

1330
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:29,520
这是什么
What's this?

1331
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:31,180
代价
The price.

1332
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:36,640
无限宝石中  灵魂宝石很特别
Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones.

1333
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:41,790
可以说它有一定的智慧
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1334
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,120
告诉我它需要什么
Tell me what it needs.

1335
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,700
为了确保拥有它的人
To ensure that whoever possesses it...

1336
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,790
理解它的力量
understands its power...

1337
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:56,010
灵魂宝石需要献祭
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1338
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:57,300
献祭什么
Of what?

1339
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:00,190
要得到灵魂宝石
In order to take the stone,

1340
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,690
你必须失去自己的珍爱之物
you must lose that which you love.

1341
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,500
以一个灵魂
A soul...

1342
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:08,770
换取一个灵魂
for a soul.

1343
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:27,510
我这一生  都梦想有一天
All my life, I dreamed of a day...

1344
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:29,390
有一瞬
a moment...

1345
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:32,680
让你得到应有的报应
when you got what you deserved.

1346
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:36,950
而我总是会失望
And I was always so disappointed.

1347
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:41,750
但现在
But now...

1348
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,500
你杀戮  折磨
You kill and torture...

1349
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,970
还说这是仁慈
and you call it mercy.

1350
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:59,230
宇宙已对你作出了评判
The universe has judged you.

1351
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:05,500
你想得到奖赏  而它拒绝了你
You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.

1352
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:08,340
你失败了
You failed.

1353
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,590
知道为什么吗
And do you wanna know why?

1354
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,590
因为你没有爱过
Because you love nothing.

1355
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,400
你谁也不爱
No one.

1356
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:23,770
不
No.

1357
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:29,200
不是吧
Really?

1358
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,550
还流泪
Tears?

1359
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,870
他不是为自己流泪
They're not for him.

1360
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,320
不
No.

1361
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,610
这不是爱
This isn't love.

1362
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,480
我曾忽视过自己的命运
I ignored my destiny once.

1363
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,400
我不能再重蹈覆辙
I cannot do that again.

1364
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,240
就算是为你也不行
Even for you.

1365
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,930
对不起了  小家伙
I'm sorry, little one.

1366
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:36,050
不
No!

1367
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:16,220
高度降至2600  030方向
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1368
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:18,170
希望你是对的
I hope you're right about this.

1369
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,810
否则我们降落的速度会比你希望的快得多
Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

1370
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:38,750
你说我们要让瓦坎达
When you said we were going to open Wakanda

1371
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:39,800
对世界开放
to the rest of the world...

1372
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:41,850
我没想到是这样
this is not what I imagined.

1373
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:43,710
那你以为是什么样
And what did you imagine?

1374
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:45,180
奥运会
The Olympics.

1375
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,830
或许开家星巴克
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1376
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:02,520
我们要鞠躬吗
Should we bow?

1377
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:04,110
要  他是国王
Yeah, he's a king.

1378
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,920
我好像总要为什么谢你
Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

1379
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:09,640
你在干嘛呢
What are you doing?

1380
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:12,310
我们这儿没这习俗
Uh, we don't do that here.

1381
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,610
我们会遭到多猛烈的袭击
So how big of an assault should we expect?

1382
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:17,760
先生  我认为你应该准备应对非常猛烈的袭击
Sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.

1383
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:18,680
情况如何
How we looking?

1384
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,380
我的御林护卫会参战
You will have my Kingsguard,

1385
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:24,110
还有边境部落  女子皇家护卫队  还有...
the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

1386
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,090
一个还算稳定的百岁老人
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1387
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,870
你怎么样了  巴基
How you been, Buck?

1388
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,550
还行吧  毕竟都快世界末日了
Not bad, for the end of the world.

1389
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:50,420
多态结构的
The structure is polymorphic.

1390
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:54,200
对  神经元是非序列排列的
Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

1391
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,160
为什么不直接
Why didn't you just

1392
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:58,270
重新编码突触  让它们协调工作
reprogram the synapses to work collectively?

1393
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:02,470
因为我们没想到
Because we didn't think of it.

1394
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:04,420
你相信你尽力了
I'm sure you did your best.

1395
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:05,440
你能做到吗
Can you do it?

1396
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:09,810
可以  但这里有超过两万亿神经元
Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.

1397
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:13,200
一点小误差就可能导致大规模的回路故障
One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.

1398
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:14,970
会需要点时间  哥哥
It will take time, brother.

1399
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,230
多长时间
How long?

1400
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:18,760
越长越好
As long as you can give me.

1401
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,070
有东西进入了大气层
Something's entered the atmosphere.

1402
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:44,350
队长  我们有麻烦了
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1403
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:56,170
天哪  我爱这个地方
God, I love this place.

1404
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:57,690
别高兴太早  各位
Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1405
01:33:57,690 --> 01:33:59,970
穹顶外有更多入侵者过来了
We got more incoming outside the dome.

1406
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,250
来不及了
It's too late.

1407
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:22,920
我们现在就得把宝石毁掉
We need to destroy the stone now.

1408
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,550
幻视  你给我躺回去
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1409
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:26,040
我们会拖住它们
We will hold them off.

1410
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,430
旺达  这石头一旦从他头部取出
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of his head...

1411
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:31,050
你就把它毁掉
you blow it to hell.

1412
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,070
我会的
I will.

1413
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:35,690
全城疏散  启动全面防御
Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1414
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:38,000
给这人拿块盾牌
And get this man a shield.

1415
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:50,290
我认为你没太搞懂状况
I don't think you get the scientifics here.

1416
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:53,120
这些环很巨大  你想移动它们
These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving...

1417
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,560
会需要大得多的东西才能把它们带动起来
you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

1418
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:57,780
-交给我  -交给你
- Leave that to me. - Leave it to you?

1419
01:34:57,820 --> 01:34:59,520
伙计  你在太空里
Buddy, you're in space.

1420
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,570
你就拿了一根绳和一个...
All you got is a rope and a...

1421
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,130
发动引擎
Fire the engines!

1422
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:30,750
再加把力  兔子
More power, rabbit!

1423
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,030
干得漂亮  小子
Well done, boy.

1424
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,630
那就是尼德威阿尔
That's Nidavellir.

1425
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:28,860
该死
Damn it.

1426
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:30,790
"该死"  "该死"是什么意思
"Damn it"? What's "Damn it"?

1427
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,330
机械装置坏了
The mechanism is crippled.

1428
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:33,940
-什么  -光圈不打开
- What? - With the iris closed,

1429
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:35,120
我就没法加热金属
I can't heat the metal.

1430
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,740
加热需要多久
How long will it take to heat it?

1431
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:38,920
几分钟  或许更久  怎么了
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1432
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:42,400
我去把它撑开
I'm gonna hold it open.

1433
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,700
那是自杀
That's suicide.

1434
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,290
不拿风暴斧就去找灭霸也是自杀
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1435
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,970
情况如何  布鲁斯
How we looking, Bruce?

1436
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:59,080
我觉得我已经掌握诀窍了
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1437
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:04,170
感觉太棒了
This is amazing, man.

1438
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:06,590
就像不用变身就成了绿巨人
It's like being the Hulk without actually...

1439
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:11,880
我没事  我没事
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1440
01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:14,640
有两处热信号
I've got two heat signatures

1441
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:16,000
要冲破林线了
breaking through the tree line.

1442
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,380
谢谢你和我们并肩作战
Thank you for standing with us.

1443
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:09,930
你那个朋友呢
Where's your other friend?

1444
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:13,130
他的命你要用命偿
You will pay for his life with yours.

1445
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:16,040
灭霸会拿到那块宝石的
Thanos will have that stone.

1446
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:18,420
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

1447
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:20,590
你是在瓦坎达
You are in Wakanda now.

1448
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:24,850
灭霸除了灰烬和鲜血什么也别想得到
Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

1449
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:26,740
我们...
We

1450
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:29,790
不吝鲜血
have blood to spare.

1451
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,380
他们投降了吗
They surrender?

1452
01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:44,650
并没有
Not exactly.

1453
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:13,010
什么鬼
What the hell?

1454
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:17,560
看来惹毛她了
Looks like we pissed her off.

1455
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:30,000
他们在自杀
They're killing themselves.

1456
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,910
看到他们的牙了吗
You see the teeth on those things?

1457
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:08,640
好了  你退后  山姆
All right, back up, Sam.

1458
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,270
别烧了你的翅膀
You're gonna get your wings singed.

1459
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:24,160
队长  如果他们绕过防线
Cap, if these things circle the perimeter

1460
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:25,080
从我们后面进来
and get in behind us...

1461
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,020
就没人挡在他们和幻视之间了
there's nothing between them and Vision.

1462
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:29,150
那我们最好确保他们都在我们眼前
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1463
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:30,340
怎么做
How do we do that?

1464
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,220
打开屏障
We open the barrier.

1465
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:41,060
听我口令  打开西北17区屏障
On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

1466
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,190
请求确认  陛下
Requesting confirmation, My King.

1467
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,000
你是说要打开屏障吗
You said open the barrier?

1468
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:46,410
听我口令
On my signal.

1469
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:48,450
这将是瓦坎达的末日
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1470
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:53,420
那也是史上最壮烈的末日
Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

1471
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:07,670
瓦坎达万岁
Wakanda forever!

1472
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:21,300
打开
Now!

1473
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:52,970
还需要多久  苏睿
How much longer, Shuri?

1474
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:54,470
我都还没开始  哥哥
I've barely begun, brother.

1475
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:56,320
你最好快点
You might want to pick up the pace.

1476
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,590
众神之父  赐我力量
Allfathers, give me strength.

1477
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:07,200
你清楚吗  小子
You understand, boy?

1478
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:10,460
你这是要承受一颗恒星的所有能量
You're about to take the full force of a star.

1479
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,730
你会没命的
It'll kill you.

1480
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:14,990
除非我死了
Only if I die.

1481
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:17,050
对
Yes.

1482
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,650
没命就是这个意思
That's what killing you means.

1483
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:50,470
撑住  撑住  托尔
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1484
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:43,010
托尔  说话  拜托
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1485
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,920
托尔  你没事吧
Thor, you okay?

1486
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:51,830
我觉得他要死了
I think he's dying.

1487
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:53,610
他需要风暴斧
He needs the axe!

1488
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:56,820
斧柄呢 
Where's the handle?

1489
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,320
树人  快帮我找斧柄
Tree, help me find the handle!

1490
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:12,300
太多了
There's too many of 'em!

1491
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:42,980
这下你们倒霉了
You guys are so screwed now!

1492
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,400
给我叫灭霸出来
Bring me Thanos!

1493
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:22,280
嗯
Oh, yeah.

1494
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,570
你是像个灭霸
You're much more of a Thanos.

1495
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,970
看来乌木喉已经死了
I take it the Maw is dead.

1496
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:36,500
今天损失惨重
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1497
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:40,630
不过  他也算完成了任务
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1498
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,640
对你恐怕不是好事
You may regret that.

1499
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,590
他带你来
He brought you face-to-face

1500
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:46,590
正面迎战魔法师了
with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1501
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:51,260
那你觉得他把你带来了哪里
And where do you think he brought you?

1502
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:55,890
我猜猜  你家吗
Let me guess. Your home?

1503
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,290
曾经是
It was.

1504
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,820
而且它曾经美丽
And it was beautiful.

1505
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,460
泰坦曾经如同很多行星
Titan was like most planets.

1506
01:47:10,930 --> 01:47:13,740
要吃饭的嘴多  能吃的却远远不够
Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1507
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:16,960
当我们面临灭绝  我提出了解决方案
And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

1508
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:19,320
屠杀
Genocide.

1509
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:24,260
但是随机  公正  不分贫富
But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.

1510
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,170
他们说我疯了
They called me a madman.

1511
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,580
我的预言最终成真了
And what I predicted came to pass.

1512
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:35,900
恭喜  你是预言家
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1513
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:37,210
我是幸存者
I'm a survivor.

1514
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:39,460
想谋杀数十亿生命的幸存者
Who wants to murder trillions.

1515
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:43,420
集齐六颗宝石  只要我一个响指
With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.

1516
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:48,730
他们就将灰飞烟灭  我认为这是慈悲
They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.

1517
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:51,780
然后呢
And then what?

1518
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:55,210
然后是久违的休息
I'd finally rest...

1519
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:58,940
在全宇宙的感激中坐看日出
and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.

1520
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:03,560
最难的抉择需要最强的意志
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

1521
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:09,210
你会发现我们的意志不比你弱
I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

1522
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:11,510
我们
Our?

1523
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:19,240
小菜一碟  奎尔
Piece of cake, Quill.

1524
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:21,810
没错  如果你的目标是激怒他  你做到了
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1525
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,630
别让他握拳
Don't let him close his fist.

1526
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:09,050
魔法
Magic.

1527
01:49:09,890 --> 01:49:10,710
魔法再来
More magic.

1528
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,690
魔法踢
Magic with a kick.

1529
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:14,160
魔法...
Magic with a...

1530
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:16,880
小虫子
Insect!

1531
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:55,680
好啊
Well, well.

1532
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:56,790
你该杀了我的
You should've killed me.

1533
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:58,970
那多浪费零件
It would've been a waste of parts!

1534
01:50:04,350 --> 01:50:05,470
卡魔拉呢
Where's Gamora?

1535
01:50:46,670 --> 01:50:47,840
晕了吗  别放手
Is he under? Don't let up.

1536
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,750
要快  他很强壮
Be quick. He is very strong.

1537
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:52,940
帕克  帮忙  过来
Parker, help! Get over here.

1538
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:54,670
她控制不住多久  开始
She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1539
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:01,870
得张开他的手指才能脱下来
We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1540
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:02,640
我以为他不好抓呢
I thought you'd be hard to catch.

1541
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,170
说清楚  这是我的计划
For the record, this was my plan.

1542
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,080
现在不怎么威风了吧
You're not so strong now, huh?

1543
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,200
卡魔拉呢
Where is Gamora?

1544
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:11,630
我的卡魔拉
My Gamora.

1545
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:13,960
胡扯
No, bullshit!

1546
01:51:14,090 --> 01:51:15,110
她在哪
Where is she?

1547
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:18,040
他很痛苦
He is in anguish.

1548

很好
Good.

1549
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:23,270
他在哀悼
He... He mourns.

1550
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:27,160
这个怪物能为什么哀悼
What does this monster have to mourn?

1551
01:51:28,170 --> 01:51:29,050
卡魔拉
Gamora.

1552
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:33,600
什么
What?

1553
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:35,430
他带她去了沃密尔星球
He took her to Vormir.

1554
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:37,940
然后带了灵魂宝石回来
He came back with the Soul Stone.

1555
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:40,150
却没有她
But she didn't.

1556
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:45,360
奎尔  你得冷静下来  明白吗
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?

1557
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:49,620
别跟他打  我们快拔下来了
Don't, don't. Don't engage. We almost got this off!

1558
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:52,590
告诉我她在撒谎
Tell me she's lying.

1559
01:51:54,710 --> 01:51:57,660
混蛋  告诉我你没那么做
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1560
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:02,480
我没办法
I had to.

1561
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:04,070
不  你没有
No, you didn't.

1562
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:05,890
你没有
No, you didn't.

1563
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,770
-你怎么能  -奎尔
- No, you didn't! - Quill!

1564
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:13,990
住手  住手
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1565
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:15,230
住手
Hey, stop! Stop!

1566
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:17,280
下来了  下来了  我抓到了
It's coming, it's coming. I got it, I got it!

1567
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:21,160
天呐
Oh, God.

1568
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:23,660
来吃瘪啊  太空狗
Come and get some, space dogs!

1569

来啊  尝尝我的厉害
Come on! Get some!

1571
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:34,030
-枪怎么卖  -不卖
- How much for the gun? - Not for sale.

1572
01:53:34,330 --> 01:53:36,140
好吧  那你胳膊怎么卖
Okay. How much for the arm?

1573
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:39,760
那胳膊我要定了
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1574
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:49,730
新发型
New haircut?

1575
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:51,940
你学我留胡子了
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1576
01:53:54,170 --> 01:53:56,280
对了  这是我朋友  树人
By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

1577
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,640
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1578
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,110
我是史蒂夫·罗杰斯
I am Steve Rogers.

1579
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:23,570
撤退  马上撤退
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1580
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,910
集中对左侧开火  山姆
Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1581
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,430
我在开火呢
I'm doing it.

1582
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:01,940
她刚刚怎么不来
Why was she up there all this time?

1583
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:04,770
她下来了  去拿吧
She's on the field. Take it.

1584
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:39,670
各位  幻视那边有情况
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1585
01:55:42,140 --> 01:55:43,410

Somebody get to Vision!

1586
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:46,130
-我去  -我就去
- I got him! - On my way.

1587
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:54,160
他会孤独一人死去  你也是
He'll die alone. As will you.

1588
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,620
她不是一个人
She's not alone.

1589
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:23,930
不  别想
Oh, no, you don't.

1590
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:25,610
这可不会像纽约那样
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1591
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:28,040
这套战甲能把绿巨人扁得求饶
This suit's already kicked the crap outta the Hulk.

1592
01:56:28,150 --> 01:56:29,640
什么  别
What? No! No!

1593
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:35,630
各位  幻视需要支援  马上
Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1594
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:38,860
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk? Hulk,

1595
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:40,860
我知道你喜欢最后时刻出场
I know you like making your entrance at the last second.

1596
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:44,260
时候到了  这已经是最后的最后时刻了
Well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.

1597
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:50,250
绿巨人  绿巨人
Hulk! Hulk!

1598
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:51,840
绿巨人
Hulk!

1599
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:54,520
不
No!

1600
01:56:55,190 --> 01:56:58,210
去你的  你个大绿混蛋
Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1601
01:56:58,210 --> 01:56:59,700
我自己来
I'll do it myself!

1602
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:02,050
来吧  好啊
Come on! Yeah!

1603
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:15,740
回见
See ya!

1604
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:29,700
绿巨人  我们有很多得谈的  哥们
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1605
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:43,260
我以为你很强大呢  机器
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1606
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:46,640
但你要死了  与常人无异
But you're dying, like any man.

1607
01:57:55,220 --> 01:57:56,190
快走
Get outta here!

1608
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:00,760
走啊
Go!

1609
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:20,830
恶心死了
That was really gross.

1610
01:58:48,350 --> 01:58:49,760
我不是叫你走吗
I thought I told you to go.

1611
01:58:50,970 --> 01:58:52,750
我们不以命换命  队长
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1612
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:05,760
接住你了  接住你了
I got you. I got you.

1613
01:59:06,580 --> 01:59:08,520
抱歉我不记得大家的名字
I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1614
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,640
你挺会变戏法  巫师
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1615
01:59:57,380 --> 02:00:00,370
但你没用过你最强大的武器
Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.

1616
02:00:03,770 --> 02:00:04,870
假的
A fake.

1617
02:00:12,770 --> 02:00:16,070
你再拿卫星砸我  我就要失控了
You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1618
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:17,700
斯塔克
Stark.

1619
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:18,720
你认识我
You know me?

1620
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:20,400
是的
I do.

1621
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:23,940
你不是唯一背负知识诅咒的人
You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

1622
02:00:25,070 --> 02:00:26,300
我唯一的诅咒就是你
My only curse is you.

1623
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:30,140
来啊
Come on!

1624
02:00:57,710 --> 02:00:59,790
费这么大事  就让我留了一滴血
All that for a drop of blood.

1625
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:45,820
我尊重你  斯塔克
You have my respect, Stark.

1626
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:50,540
等我完事  还有一半人类能存活下来
When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.

1627
02:01:56,230 --> 02:01:57,920
希望他们会记得你
I hope they remember you.

1628
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:09,210
住手
Stop.

1629
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:16,930
饶他一命
Spare his life...

1630
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:19,510
我就把宝石给你
and I will give you the stone.

1631
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:24,890
不许耍花招
No tricks.

1632
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:30,320
别
Don't.

1633
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,410
还剩一个
One to go.

1634
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:34,640
他在哪
Where is he?

1635
02:03:44,130 --> 02:03:45,380
我们刚刚输了吗
Did we just lose?

1636
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:50,620
你为什么要那么做
Why would you do that?

1637
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:56,110
这是终局了
We're in the endgame now.

1638
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:23,570
你没事吧
Are you okay?

1639
02:04:26,010 --> 02:04:27,780
什么  怎么了
What? What is it?

1640
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:31,050
他来了
He's here.

1641
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:45,100
各位  到我这里  来敌人了
Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1642
02:04:47,970 --> 02:04:49,350
怎么回事
What the hell?

1643
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:16,530
队长
Cap.

1644
02:05:17,230 --> 02:05:18,010
就是他
That's him.

1645
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:23,280
注意  精神点
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1646
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:48,830
旺达
Wanda.

1647
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:50,850
是时候了
It's time.

1648
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:52,140
不
No.

1649
02:05:52,460 --> 02:05:54,600
他们无法阻止他  旺达  但我们能
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1650
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:55,800
看着我
Look at me.

1651
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:57,930
你有能力摧毁宝石
You have the power to destroy the stone.

1652
02:05:57,930 --> 02:05:59,850
-别  -你必须这么做  旺达  求你
- Don't. - You must do it. Wanda, please.

1653
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:04,510
我们没时间了
We are out of time.

1654
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:06,380
我不能
I can't.

1655
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:07,740
你可以的
Yes, you can.

1656
02:06:08,750 --> 02:06:09,590
你可以的
You can.

1657
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:14,190
如果他拿到宝石  半个宇宙都会死
If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

1658
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,270
这不公平
It's not fair.

1659
02:06:19,030 --> 02:06:20,710
不该由你来  但就是这样
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1660
02:06:22,500 --> 02:06:23,500
没事的
It's all right.

1661
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:26,800
你不会伤害我的
You could never hurt me.

1662
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:37,280
我只感觉到你
I just feel you.

1663
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:02,240
没事的
It's all right.

1664
02:08:12,280 --> 02:08:13,370
没事的
It's all right.

1665
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:18,910
我爱你
I love you.

1666
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:50,310
我理解  孩子
I understand, my child.

1667
02:08:51,870 --> 02:08:53,210
比任何人都能理解
Better than anyone.

1668
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,780
你才不会懂呢
You could never.

1669
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:04,480
今天  我失去的远超你的想象
Today, I lost more than you can know.

1670
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:08,740
但现在不是哀悼的时候
But now is no time to mourn.

1671
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:15,330
现在  时间不存在了
Now is no time at all.

1672
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:40,100
不
No!

1673
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,060
我说过
I told you...

1674
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:42,580
我会要你偿命的
you'd die for that.

1675
02:10:56,940 --> 02:10:58,810
你该
You should have...

1676
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:02,610
你该
You should...

1677
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:08,250
你该砍头的
You should have gone for the head.

1678
02:11:10,470 --> 02:11:11,400
不
No!

1679
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:45,590
女儿
Daughter?

1680
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:54,620
你做到了吗
Did you do it?

1681
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:57,910
是的
Yes.

1682
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:07,590
代价是什么
What did it cost?

1683
02:12:11,630 --> 02:12:12,670
一切
Everything.

1684
02:12:23,490 --> 02:12:24,470
你做了什么
What did you do?

1685
02:12:26,210 --> 02:12:27,350
你做了什么
What'd you do?

1686
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:42,180
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

1687
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:46,600
托尔
Thor.

1688
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:50,900
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

1689
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:52,510
史蒂夫
Steve?

1690
